\chapter{Optimizing patients travel}

\section{Context}

Cancer treatment delay is a problem in health systems worldwide, increasing mortality for many types of cancers \cite{hanna_mortality_2020}, including breast cancer \cite{caplan_delay_1992, williams_assessment_2015, pace_delays_2015}. Distance between patients residence and diagnosing hospitals is among the factors causing these delays, especially for cancer types that are hard to diagnose \cite{flytkjaer_virgilsen_cancer_2019}. While accessibility to healthcare is growing, research found that 8.9\% of the global population (646 million people) could not reach healthcare within one hour if they had access to motorized transport \cite{weiss_global_2020}. Thus, a non insignificant part of the population might be exposed to lower prognosis.

\subsection{Centralized care}

Northern countries, such as the UK, USA and Canada, have been implementing a policy of centralizing the care of patients for many specialized services \cite{kelly_are_2016}. With such policy, patients are directed to a limited number of hospitals with higher volumes and more specialized surgeons. Centralized care is beneficial for patients undergoing high-risk procedures, these surgeries have lower mortality rates when performed by high-volume surgeons \cite{pekala_centralization_2021,birkmeyer_surgeon_2003,finks_trends_2011,hollenbeck_getting_2007,goossens-laan_systematic_2011}.

However, the benefits of centralized healthcare have been debated. A centralized approach often requires patients to travel far away from their home and their local community hospitals \cite{woo_centralisation_2012}. Patients subject to longer travels to reach a specialized hospital are likely to be affected by the travel burden and separation from their social environment \cite{payne_impact_2000}. In the debate between local versus centralized healthcare provision, there are evidence of an association between travel distance and health outcomes \cite{kelly_are_2016}.

\subsection{The impact of travelling on cancer patients}

We are now interested in the impact of travel on cancer patients. Unsurprisingly, travel to cancer treatment is inconvenient for some patients and might even act as a barrier to treatment \cite{payne_impact_2000}. Research also showed that patients who lived far from hospitals and had to travel more than 50 miles had a more advanced stage at diagnosis, lower adherence to encoded treatments, a worse prognosis, and a worse quality of life \cite{ambroggi_distance_2015}. More research linked travel burden with lower treatment compliance \cite{dutta_evaluation_2013,guidry_transportation_1997}. The distance from the hospital influences the choice of appropriate treatment by cancer patients. In breast cancer, patients living farther from a radiation treatment facility more often underwent mastectomy instead of breast conservative surgery \cite{schroen_impact_2005,celaya_travel_2006,voti_treatment_2006,meden_relationship_2002,nattinger_relationship_2001,boscoe_geographic_2011} or did not undergo radiotherapy after breast cancer surgery \cite{satasivam_dilemma_2014,schroen_impact_2005,celaya_travel_2006}. In non small cell lung cancer, patients were most likely to not undergo potentially curative surgery if they lived far from a specialist hospital and only attended a general hospital for their care \cite{tracey_patients_2015}. Moreover, the necessity for repeated visits for cancer diagnosis and treatment makes distance an even more important issue for the patient\cite{guidry_transportation_1997}. However, for hard to diagnose cancer type like rectum or testis cancers, distance was associated with decreasing odds of advanced disease stage \cite{virgilsen_travel_2019}. This is possibly due to being treated in more specialized hospitals.

\subsection{Living in rural areas}

The negative effects of centralized healthcare are even more pronounced for patients living in rural areas. Indeed, rural cancer patients face more challenges in receiving care, due to the limited availability of providers and clinical trials, as well as transportation barriers and financial issues \cite{charlton_challenges_2015}. There are evidence of poorer treatments and outcomes for patients living in rural areas. For instance, in Australia, poorer survival and variations in clinical management have been reported for breast cancer women living in non metropolitan areas \cite{dasgupta_variations_2018}. Still in Australia, breast cancer women treated in a rural hospital had a reduced likelihood of breast conservative surgery \cite{hall_unequal_2004}.  The hazard of death from ovarian cancer was greater in women treated at a public general hospital than in women treated at a gynecological oncology service (GOS) \cite{tracey_effects_2014}. Contacting a provincial hospital instead of a university hospital might lead to diagnosis and treatment delays, which could be improved by a better referral system \cite{thongsuksai_delay_2000}. In Australia, patients living farther from a radiotherapy service were more likely to die of rectal cancer, with a 6\% risk increase for each additional 100km \cite{baade_distance_2011}. In Rwanda, rural breast cancer patients who lived in the same district as breast cancer hospitals had a decreased likelihood of system delay \cite{pace_delays_2015}. In Canada, place of residence seems to influence health outcomes in patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma \cite{lee_effect_2014}. They found that rural and metropolitan patients had similar survival; however, patients in small and medium urban areas experienced worse outcomes than those in metropolitan areas. Thus, rural culture might have a dual effect on health outcomes. On one hand, distance, transportation, and health services shortage are barriers to healthcare. On the other hand, rural culture comes with community belonging, and deeper relationship with health care professionals, which might be beneficial for some patients \cite{brundisini_chronic_2013}.

\subsection{Carbon footprint of cancer patients}

% Transportation and GHG
% TODO
The transport sector is the number one emitter of greenhouse gases in France, with 30\% of emissions. The value attributed to the emissions generated are split between the operating phase (fuel combustion) and the upstream phase (fuel extraction, refining and distribution). The number one greenhouse gas emitted by the transport industry is carbon dioxide \ac{co2}.
France has set itself the objective of reducing its emissions by 75\% by the year 2050. In this scenario, patients travel will be impacted.

Air pollution due to car emissions increases the risk of developing lung cancer \cite{raaschou-nielsen_air_2013}.

% Health and climate change
% TODO
The \ac{ipcc}, warned that global warming will significantly affect hundreds of millions of people \cite{change_climate_2015}.
The Lancet Countdown on health and climate change started to review annually the relation between health and climate change \cite{watts_2020_2021}.
The health care sector is an important contributor to \ac{co2} emissions. International comparison of health care carbon footprints: on average, the health carbon footprint in 2014 constituted 5.5\% of the total national carbon footprint equivalent to the food industry in some countries \cite{pichler_international_2019}.
A large share of these carbon emissions is due to patients journeys \cite{andrews_carbon_2013,nicolet_what_2022} because most patients travel by car \cite{forner_carbon_2021}. With regionalization of care, patients are incentivized to be treated in large hospitals for better outcome \cite{eskander_health_2016}. Such hospitals are in urban areas, and the populations living in rural areas will have to travel longer to reach these centers, resulting in higher carbon emissions.

Dans le domaine de la cancérologie, aucune étude n'a évalué le coût écologique de la prise en charge d'un patient. C'est un facteur totalement omis dans le parcours de soin. Une prise de conscience est nécessaire. L'oncologie comporte des problématiques spécifiques : l'intrication avec de nombreuses spécialités telles que la radiologie, la chimiothérapie, la médecine nucléaire, la chirurgie, chacune ayant une empreinte carbone propre. S'y surajoute un parcours de soin avec un suivi prolongé, une répétition d'examens, des allers retour ville-hôpital, un nombre important d'études cliniques novatrices pouvant entraîner une « migration » de patient ou l'utilisation de molécules à coût environnemental majoré. Dresser l'état des lieux écologique de la cancérologie en France est un premier pas indispensable pour permettre l'évolution de nos pratiques et répondre aux enjeux globaux. Un des obstacles de ce changement reste l'aspect économique. L'atteinte des objectifs environnementaux a conduit à la mise en place d'une fiscalité plus contraignante depuis l'Accord de Paris. Ce dernier stipule, qu'à partir de 2020, les structures qui ne s'acquitteront pas de leurs obligations dans les proportions et les délais indiqués devront payer une taxe carbone. L'innovation sera fondamentale pour relever ce nouveau défi de la médecine. Plusieurs pistes peuvent être proposées afin d'évoluer dans la bonne direction, notamment privilégier les circuits courts (repérage, examens groupés ...), repenser le suivi des patients grâce à la vidéo consultation, utilisation des transports en communs \cite{guillon_empreinte_2020}.

The health sector has a responsibility to take climate action \cite{health_care_without_harm_hcwh_global_2021}. Health care makes up more than 4.4\% of net global climate emissions. Under a business as usual scenario—without climate action inside and outside the sector—health care's absolute global emissions would grow enormously from a 2014 baseline and more than triple by 2050, reaching six gigatons a year. Fossil fuel combustion is the dominant source of health care climate emissions. The use of coal, oil, and gas to power hospitals, health care-related travel, and the manufacture and transport of health care products comprises 84\% of all of health care's climate emissions across facility operations, supply chain, and the broader economy. Countries' Paris Agreement commitments could cut projected health care emissions growth by 70\%.
Health care decarbonization should be based on the principle of common but with differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities: High-income countries, whose health systems are most responsible for global health care emissions (per capita and historically), need to act most quickly and take the greatest responsibility for addressing the climate crisis; Middle-income countries must invest in health system development that takes them on a pathway to zero emissions and avoids replicating the carbon-intensive health delivery model of wealthier countries; Low-income countries need to deploy low-carbon and zero emissions technology that enhances their ability to develop their health systems and provide health access and services to all. Ultimately, all health systems will need to be closing in on zero emissions by 2050. Health care climate solutions can be more cost effective than business as usual. Climate-smart solutions can save health care systems operating costs and reduce countries' health care costs by reducing the burden of disease caused by pollution.
The Road Map identifies three interrelated, overlapping decarbonization pathways that the sector needs to navigate in order to address these emissions. Spanning and connecting these paths are seven high-impact actions. To chart a course to zero emissions, health care must follow these interwoven pathways and implement related high-impact actions simultaneously:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Pathway 1: Decarbonize health care delivery, facilities, and operations.
    \item Pathway 2: Decarbonize health care's supply chain. More than 70\% of health care's climate footprint comes from ``Scope 3'' emissions, much of which originate in the global supply chain.
    \item Pathway 3: Accelerate decarbonization in the wider economy and society. Every aspect of the health care supply chain and delivery is reliant on other industries that provide energy, chemicals, building materials, packaging, infrastructure, transport, food, and more.
\end{itemize}

Getting to zero emissions will require a series of high-impact, cross-cutting actions that span the three pathways. The implementation of these actions will result in a major reduction of health care greenhouse gas emissions.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Power health care with 100\% clean, renewable electricity.
    \item Invest in zero emissions buildings and infrastructure.
    \item Transition to zero emissions, sustainable travel and transport.
    \item Provide healthy, sustainably grown food.
    \item Incentivize and produce low-carbon pharmaceuticals.
    \item Implement circular health care and sustainable health care waste management.
    \item Establish greater health system effectiveness.
\end{itemize}

Beyond the seven high-impact actions, we project that without additional transformation, annual health care emissions will still stand at 1.1 gigatons in 2050. This health care emissions gap needs to be minimized over the course of the next three decades. Bridging the gap will require scaling-up measurable health care climate action, while implementing new initiatives that will require research, innovation, and the exploration of health-based residual emissions management initiatives. It also presents an opportunity to rethink and redefine how health care is understood and delivered.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Investing in further research and seeding climate and health innovation centers to deepen emission reduction across the sector.
    \item Establishing Green UHC by integrating sustainability with Universal Health Coverage.
    \item Maximizing telehealth.
    \item Integrating climate-smart health care services and infrastructure into emergency response and pandemic preparedness.
    \item Addressing the social and environmental determinants of health by establishing disease prevention as climate change prevention and vice versa.
    \item Reinventing financing systems to support healthy people on a healthy planet.
    \item Developing health sector-based residual emissions management solutions.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Telemedicine}

Teleoncology models are used increasingly throughout the world as a means to provide access to quality cancer care for people in rural, remote and other disadvantaged settings. Some authors have suggested that teleoncology is merely about avoiding long distance travel. In this commentary we argue that the benefits of teleoncology extend beyond those of the patients and their families to the rural health system and beyond \cite{sabesan_are_2014}.

Teleoncology model of care allows rural and Indigenous cancer patients to receive specialist consultations and chemotherapy treatments closer to home, thus minimising the access difficulties faced by the rural sector \cite{sabesan_telemedicine_2012}.

It is feasible for medical oncologists from tertiary centres to assess acute cancer patients and initiate cancer care in a timely and safe fashion at rural hospitals through the use of telemedicine, if the infrastructure and human resources are adequate at the rural sites \cite{sabesan_timely_2014}.

While most centers use teleoncology to complement their face-to-face outreach services, some centers have replaced face-to-face with teleoncology models. This was accepted by the patient after explaining to them why a physical examination was not always required. Patients had a physical exam within 60 days of their telehealth consultation. Importantly, there were no changes in the clinical management due to the lack of physical examination by specialists. Telesupervision models can be beneficial in training medical, nursing, and allied health trainees and staff at rural centers \cite{sabesan_medical_2014}.

Our evaluation suggests that teleoncology is an acceptable model of care for Indigenous patients, with high levels of satisfaction expressed from patients, families and HWs. Strategies for change are: Mandatory informed consent procedure for all patients offered with VC; Formalised competency training for staff in skills essential to maintain safe practices in teleoncology; Clear clinical documentation to facilitate improved communication in patient management between medical staff at main centre and distant sites; Further efforts in promotion, education and support for staff to participate in telemedicine \cite{mooi_teleoncology_2012}.

Describe the different e-health tools and their potential clinical impacts in oncology, as already reported at every level of care, including education, prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and monitoring \cite{bertucci_outpatient_2019}:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Education: From the patient perspective, the lack of general information on diseases and treatments is a major issue concerning participation in the decision-making for and adherence to treatments. Websites, social networks, forums, and smartphone applications could solve this issue as they enable immediate access to unlimited information. Access to information is also important for oncologists in routine practice, and these allow for rapid access to the most recent and up-to-date data, guidelines, drug lists, and corresponding toxicities.
    \item Prevention: Websites inform patients about potential risk factors and also help with modifying exposure. Smartphone applications can repeatedly deliver proactive and discreet information and advice anywhere and at any time, immediately attracting the user's attention and prompting for urgent responses as necessary according to the context.
    \item Screening: Screening may also be improved by e-health [50], notably for cervical cancer. In Tanzania, a screening program dedicated to cervical uterine carcinoma was set up using smartphones. Nurses located in the most distant regions of the country used their smartphones to take pictures of cervices and send them by multimedia messaging service (MMS)to physicians in a cancer center. The physicians would then respond via text message with the appropriate actions to take.
    \item Diagnosis: Diagnosis may also benefit from e-health tools that allow for remote clinical examination, as recently reported for non-invasive detection of anemia using only patient-sourced photos.
    \item Treatment: E-health could be a major asset in facilitating treatment ``outside the walls'', by aiding in improved compliance, toxicity management, and earlier discharge from hospitals.
    \item Post-Treatment Follow-Up: Follow-up consultations aim for the early detection of relapses and management of possible persistent or late drug toxicities, and also identify disease-related psychological, social, and professional problems in patients' and families' lives. Unfortunately, general practitioners feel poorly trained in these areas while patients prefer trusting their oncologist. However, for oncologists, the average duration for consultations has not changed, even though the number of consultations is constantly increasing. Access to these consultations in cancer centers may also be problematic for patients that live far from the hospital or have transportation difficulties, which likely contributes to the relatively worse outcomes of patients living in rural areas or underserved suburbs. E-health could solve these issues as well via virtual consultations with oncologists. Digital follow-up may also improve survival. E-health technologies may also improve the quality of survival. They promote emotional well-being in breast cancer patients within the three months of diagnosis.
\end{enumerate}

% Telemedicine limitations
Cancer care ``outside the walls'' is becoming a critical issue and will have human, economic, and organizational consequences. Besides the expected benefits, several questions and fears are emerging \cite{bertucci_outpatient_2019}. However, evaluation of mobile applications is crucial and several studies have pointed out significant drawbacks, such as a lack of updates and medical scientific validation. There are also questions regarding the risk of patient morale and isolation. Another important challenge is the need for physical examination, as it is more difficult to build an atmosphere of trust during remote consultations and the examinations are of inferior quality. A further potential limitation of e-health is the digital divide, i.e., certain categories of patients (elderly, fragile, foreign, poorly educated, rural, etc.) have difficulties in accessing the Internet or do not have the necessary broadband connections.

Plot (A) displays the patients flows from municipalities on the right to care centers on the left. The flows are colored by the resulting \ac{co2} emissions. \ac{co2} emissions are calculated by multiplying the travel distance by the number of travels and the car average consumption. We can see that the higher \ac{co2} emissions are not issued by travels with lots of patients, but instead from travels with fewer patients but much longer drives. This is emphasized on plot (B), showing the \ac{co2} emissions resulting from patients living in Bourg en Bresse area. Indeed, the 42 travels to Hopital Lyon Sud emitted three times as much \ac{co2} than the 253 travels to Centre Hospitalier de Fleyriat.
