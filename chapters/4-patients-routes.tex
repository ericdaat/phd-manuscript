\chapter{Optimizing patients travel}

\section{Context}

Cancer treatment delay is a problem in health systems worldwide, increasing mortality for many types of cancers \cite{hanna_mortality_2020}, including breast cancer \cite{caplan_delay_1992, williams_assessment_2015, pace_delays_2015}. Distance between patients residence and diagnosing hospitals is among the factors causing these delays, especially for cancer types that are hard to diagnose \cite{flytkjaer_virgilsen_cancer_2019}. While accessibility to healthcare is growing, research found that 8.9\% of the global population (646 million people) could not reach healthcare within one hour if they had access to motorized transport \cite{weiss_global_2020}. Thus, a non insignificant part of the population might be exposed to lower prognosis.

\subsection{Centralized care}

Northern countries, such as the UK, USA and Canada, have been implementing a policy of centralizing the care of patients for many specialized services \cite{kelly_are_2016}. With such policy, patients are directed to a limited number of hospitals with higher volumes and more specialized surgeons. Centralized care is beneficial for patients undergoing high-risk procedures, these surgeries have lower mortality rates when performed by high-volume surgeons \cite{pekala_centralization_2021,birkmeyer_surgeon_2003,finks_trends_2011,hollenbeck_getting_2007,goossens-laan_systematic_2011}.

However, the benefits of centralized healthcare have been debated. A centralized approach often requires patients to travel far away from their home and their local community hospitals \cite{woo_centralisation_2012}. Patients subject to longer travels to reach a specialized hospital are likely to be affected by the travel burden and separation from their social environment \cite{payne_impact_2000}. In the debate between local versus centralized healthcare provision, there are evidence of an association between travel distance and health outcomes \cite{kelly_are_2016}.

\subsection{The impact of travelling on cancer patients}

We are now interested in the impact of travel on cancer patients. Unsurprisingly, travel to cancer treatment is inconvenient for some patients and might even act as a barrier to treatment \cite{payne_impact_2000}. Research also showed that patients who lived far from hospitals and had to travel more than 50 miles had a more advanced stage at diagnosis, lower adherence to encoded treatments, a worse prognosis, and a worse quality of life \cite{ambroggi_distance_2015}. More research linked travel burden with lower treatment compliance \cite{dutta_evaluation_2013,guidry_transportation_1997}. The distance from the hospital influences the choice of appropriate treatment by cancer patients. In breast cancer, patients living farther from a radiation treatment facility more often underwent mastectomy instead of breast conservative surgery \cite{schroen_impact_2005,celaya_travel_2006,voti_treatment_2006,meden_relationship_2002,nattinger_relationship_2001,boscoe_geographic_2011} or did not undergo radiotherapy after breast cancer surgery \cite{satasivam_dilemma_2014,schroen_impact_2005,celaya_travel_2006}. In non small cell lung cancer, patients were most likely to not undergo potentially curative surgery if they lived far from a specialist hospital and only attended a general hospital for their care \cite{tracey_patients_2015}. Moreover, the necessity for repeated visits for cancer diagnosis and treatment makes distance an even more important issue for the patient\cite{guidry_transportation_1997}. However, for hard to diagnose cancer type like rectum or testis cancers, distance was associated with decreasing odds of advanced disease stage \cite{virgilsen_travel_2019}. This is possibly due to being treated in more specialized hospitals.

\subsection{Living in rural areas}

The negative effects of centralized healthcare are even more pronounced for patients living in rural areas. Indeed, rural cancer patients face more challenges in receiving care, due to the limited availability of providers and clinical trials, as well as transportation barriers and financial issues \cite{charlton_challenges_2015}. There are evidence of poorer treatments and outcomes for patients living in rural areas. For instance, in Australia, poorer survival and variations in clinical management have been reported for breast cancer women living in non metropolitan areas \cite{dasgupta_variations_2018}. Still in Australia, breast cancer women treated in a rural hospital had a reduced likelihood of breast conservative surgery \cite{hall_unequal_2004}.  The hazard of death from ovarian cancer was greater in women treated at a public general hospital than in women treated at a gynecological oncology service (GOS) \cite{tracey_effects_2014}. Contacting a provincial hospital instead of a university hospital might lead to diagnosis and treatment delays, which could be improved by a better referral system \cite{thongsuksai_delay_2000}. In Australia, patients living farther from a radiotherapy service were more likely to die of rectal cancer, with a 6\% risk increase for each additional 100km \cite{baade_distance_2011}. In Rwanda, rural breast cancer patients who lived in the same district as breast cancer hospitals had a decreased likelihood of system delay \cite{pace_delays_2015}. In Canada, place of residence seems to influence health outcomes in patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma \cite{lee_effect_2014}. They found that rural and metropolitan patients had similar survival; however, patients in small and medium urban areas experienced worse outcomes than those in metropolitan areas. Thus, rural culture might have a dual effect on health outcomes. On one hand, distance, transportation, and health services shortage are barriers to healthcare. On the other hand, rural culture comes with community belonging, and deeper relationship with health care professionals, which might be beneficial for some patients \cite{brundisini_chronic_2013}.

\subsection{Health and climate change}

The World Health Organization called climate change the greatest threat to global health in the 21st century, significantly affecting hundreds of millions of people \cite{change_climate_2015}. The United Nations created the \ac{ipcc} to assess the science related to climate change and provide governments with scientific information that they can use to develop climate policies.
The health care sector is an important contributor to \ac{co2} emissions. An international comparison of health care carbon footprints showed that, on average, the health carbon footprint in 2014 constituted 5.5\% of the total national carbon footprint \cite{pichler_international_2019}. Hence, the health sector has a responsibility to take climate action \cite{health_care_without_harm_hcwh_global_2021}. Especially since the Paris Agreement, where countries agreed to cut \ac{ghg} emissions to keep global warming below 2Â°C. Today, hospitals are powered by fossile energy such as coal, oil and gas. Healthcare related travels, and the manufacture and transport of healthcare products are also major causes of \ac{ghg} emissions. Ultimately, all health systems will need to reach near zero emissions by 2050, which can be more cost effective than business as usual. The Lancet Countdown on health and climate change started to review annually the relation between health and climate change \cite{watts_2020_2021}. A large share of these carbon emissions is due to patients journeys \cite{andrews_carbon_2013,nicolet_what_2022} because most patients travel by car \cite{forner_carbon_2021}. With centralization of care, patients are encouraged to be treated in large hospitals for better outcome \cite{eskander_health_2016}. Such hospitals are in urban areas, and the populations living in rural areas will have to travel longer to reach these centers, resulting in higher carbon emissions.

In France, few studies have evaluated the ecological impact of cancer care \cite{guillon_empreinte_2020}. The Shift Project is a French think tank that works towards a carbon-free economy. As a non-profit organization, they inform and influence the debate on the energy transition. In 2021, the Shift Project released a report on how to decarbonize the health care sector in France \cite{the_shift_project_plan_2021}. They identified that most of the \ac{ghg} emissions were scope 3 emissions, which are indirect emissions that occur in the hospitals value chain. Among these emissions, the largest source are pharmaceuticals and medical device buying, followed by patients and visitors transportation. The Shift Project states that emissions related to transportation should be cut by 99\%, through measures like increasing public transportation and telemedicine.

Telemedicine includes all medical practices that allow patients to be treated remotely from a health facility. It has been used increasingly around the world, even in oncology where it is sometimes referred as teleoncology \cite{mooi_teleoncology_2012,sabesan_are_2014,sabesan_timely_2014,sabesan_medical_2014}. Teleoncology models have been used to provide access to specialized cancer care for people in rural, remote and other disadvantaged areas, which minimizes the access difficulties and disparities \cite{sabesan_telemedicine_2012, sabesan_are_2014}. Teleoncology models can also be beneficial in training medical, nursing, and allied health trainees and staff at rural centers \cite{sabesan_medical_2014}. Research reported multiple benefits of telemedicine at every level of care, including education, prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and monitoring \cite{bertucci_outpatient_2019}. However, besides the expected benefits, several questions and fears are emerging \cite{bertucci_outpatient_2019}. First, there is a risk of patient isolation, due to the absence of in-person meeting. It is also more difficult to build an atmosphere of trust during remote consultations and the examinations might be of inferior quality. Finally, digital divide is a major limitation of e-health, as certain categories of patients do not have access to the internet or to a smartphone.

Municipalities are sized by the number of residing patients. Care centers are sized by the number of treated patients. Flows represent patients travel and are sized by the number of patients traveling from a municipality to a care center. The flows are colored based on the travel score quantile. We can easily identify that the patients living in smaller municipalities are more likely to experience tedious travel. Larger care centers often receive patients from these smaller municipalities.

        \textbf{Patients travel, sized by number of travels, and colored by \ac{co2} emission.} We study the patients travel in Bourg-en-Bresse area, a sub-urban and rural area located in Auvergne-Rhone-Alpes region. Plot (A) displays the patients flows from municipalities on the right to care centers on the left. The flows are colored by the resulting \ac{co2} emissions. \ac{co2} emissions are calculated by multiplying the travel distance by the number of travels and the car average consumption. We can see that the higher \ac{co2} emissions are not issued by travels with lots of patients, but instead from travels with fewer patients but much longer drives. This is emphasized on plot (B), showing the \ac{co2} emissions resulting from patients living in Bourg en Bresse area. Indeed, the 42 travels to Hopital Lyon Sud emitted three times as much \ac{co2} than the 253 travels to Centre Hospitalier de Fleyriat.
