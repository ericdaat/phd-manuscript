\chapter{Transparency in healthcare}

\section{Context}

\subsection{The communications revolution}

Over the past few years, there has been a massive change in the way we communicate and interact with information. The amount of data and content available to the public keeps increasing, as well as the number of information delivery platforms. Studies define this phenomenon as ``the communications revolution'' \cite{viswanath_communications_2012}. Smartphones democratization and adoption rate are partly responsible for this revolution. Indeed, a large and growing number of people own a smartphone, enabling them to access information anytime and anywhere. Through this, there has been a change in how people access and use information. With the increasing number of media sources, mass audience is now split into smaller groups who share common characteristics and interests. Also, the growth of online audience is now far outpacing the other media. As a benefit of this communication revolution, it is getting easier to access resources online, even technical resources such as technical reports and scientific articles. While these materials may not always be intended for a mainstream audience, their availability offers opportunities for access and interpretation by different groups.

\subsection{Healthcare online resources}

The healthcare sector is no exception in this revolution, and health resources are increasingly available online \cite{viswanath_science_2005,viswanath_communications_2012}, changing how patients interact with health providers. Communication has been found to play a central role in cancer prevention and control. It can provide information on cancer prevention, monitor lifestyles and health behaviors, promote participatory decision making during cancer detection, diagnosis, and treatment, and foster quality of life during survivorship or end of life \cite{viswanath_communications_2012}. When diagnosed with cancer patients and their family members lives change radically. They receive treatments and have to make choices with serious consequences. Such diseases and treatments are complex, but should be understood before decisions are made. Patients and their family members should be provided with intelligible and up to date information on the stage of disease, treatment options and complementary therapies \cite{butow_dynamics_1997,cassileth_information_1980}.

Multiple benefits of bringing more information to the patients have been reported. Involving cancer patients in decision-making on their pathways improves their satisfaction and quality of life, compliance with treatment and their ability to manage symptoms \cite{johnson_effects_1982,hack_feasibility_1999,mohide_randomised_1996,mcpherson_effective_2001, sheabudgell_information_2014,huchcroft_testing_1984,cegala_patient_2003,viswanath_science_2005}. Moreover, medically related education interventions are most effective when they are tailored to patients' individual needs, especially for cancer patients \cite{cegala_patient_2003}. Through all these benefits, it is clear that monitoring patient information seeking experiences over time is important \cite{finney_rutten_cancer-related_2016}.

\subsection{Patients information seeking}

As a matter of fact, patients are often seeking information during their pathways. In the United States of America, a survey from the Health Information National Trends (HINTS) \cite{hesse_trust_2005} measured online health activities, levels of trust, and source preference for 6,369 people. They observed that physicians remained the most trusted source of information, despite an increasing number of people looking for information online.

However, there is increasing evidence in the literature that patients are often not satisfied with the information they received. Some reported to lack information on their disease and its consequences \cite{mcpherson_effective_2001}, while others forget or misunderstand the information conveyed \cite{ley_communicating_1988,hogbin_getting_1989}. The interaction with their physician has also been cited as a major cause of dissatisfaction \cite{stewart_effective_1995,bartlett_effects_1984} at all stages of illness \cite{higginson_palliative_1990}. Patients reported insufficient time spent on communication during the clinical encounter and physicians inability to keep up with the most current information and advances in cancer care \cite{anderson_impact_2003}. Some patients reported incorrect diagnosis, or not receiving the most up-to-date cancer information from their physician, especially for rare cancers \cite{dolce_internet_2011}. Patients who need health information but experience difficulties have been found at risk of experiencing poorer psychosocial health \cite{arora_barriers_2002}.

A Canadian study surveyed patients attending appointments at follow-up cancer clinics in Calgary, Alberta \cite{sheabudgell_information_2014} between 2011 and 2012. They approached 648 patients and obtained responses from 411 one of them. The study aimed at: identifying information needs of patients when meeting their physician for a follow-up; listing patients preferences on how to receive information. Here are the results they gathered regarding information seeking patterns. The most frequently reported source of information was the Internet (57.4\%); health provider (32.6\%), brochures or pamphlets (25.1\%), and cancer organizations (24.3\%). The most frequently reported types of information sought included information about a specific type of cancer (43.1\%), treatment or cures for cancer (29.4\%), prognosis or recovery from cancer (29.0\%), and prevention of cancer (27.0\%). The least frequently reported types of cancer information sought included where to get medical care (3.4\%), paying for medical care or insurance (4.6\%), and cancer organizations (5.4\%). Regarding trust, the physician or health care provider was largely the most trusted source of information, followed by Internet, and family and friends. The least trusted sources of information included radio, newspaper, and television.

More evidence is reported on the use of the internet for health information retrieval \cite{chen_impact_2001,pereira_internet_2000,ziebland_how_2004,dolce_internet_2011}. For instance, an online questionnaire was administered to participants of cancer-related communities hosted by the Association of Cancer Online Resources (ACOR) \cite{dolce_internet_2011}. As a result, 488 participants shared their personal experiences on why and how they accessed online health resources. Participants who experienced a lack of informational support related to procedures found blogs and testimonies online that helped them to know what to expect from a physical and emotional perspective. Moreover, for rare diseases, physicians might actually benefit from patients looking from additional information online, as it could bring additional knowledge to them, and even change their plans for care. Aware patients can also challenge their physicians by asking meaningful questions and participate in the tailoring of their treatment plans. Finally, online communities allowed patients to identify physicians with a proven track record in cancer care. They endorsed care providers who took the time to answer questions, as well as specialists from major cancer centers, that brought superior care which led to better outcome.

To sum up, the increased usage of the Internet by cancer patients puts new demands on health care professionals. Patients need advice about how to find reliable and credible web sites and also help with authenticating and interpreting the information they find \cite{carlsson_cancer_2009}.

\subsection{Bringing transparency in cancer surgery}

While patients are looking for informations on their symptoms, diseases and treatments, it would be crucial for them to know better about their physician's ability, especially for cancer surgery. In cancer care, surgery is one of the most important part of the treatment, and is directly linked to the surgeon ability.

Surgeon and hospital-related factors have been found to be direct predictors of outcome in colorectal cancer surgery \cite{renzulli_influence_2006, bonati_surgeon_2021}. In breast cancer, patients managed by high-volume surgeons were more likely to have breast-conserving surgery (BCS) than those managed by low-volume surgeons \cite{mcdermott_surgeon_2013}. Moreover, breast cancer patients who receive treatment from experienced and specialized surgeons are more likely to receive the standard sentinel lymph node biopsy \cite{yen_surgeon_2014}. The surgeon's expertise and learning curve is directly related to the patient's outcome \cite{renzulli_learning_2005}. A low surgeon or hospital caseload may be compensated by intensified supervision or by improved training and teaching \cite{bonati_surgeon_2021}. From all these findings, it is questioned whether surgeons should have an ethical obligation to inform patients of their surgical volume and outcomes \cite{glaser_surgeon_2019}. One way to monitor the surgeons abilities is the use of quality indicators, which have been developed in high income countries and contributed to improved quality of care and patient outcomes over time \cite{nietz_quality_2020}.

\subsection{Hospital recommender system}

The increase in the amount of available medical information resulted in some difficulties for patients when searching for suitable doctors \cite{narducci_recommender_2015, hoens_reliable_2010}. This gap opens the need for patient-doctor matchmaking, in which patients can find the right doctors to build a trust relationship \cite{han_hybrid_2018}.

Recommender systems are a typical way to solve such problems. They have been integrated into online retailers, streaming services, and social networks to facilitate users' item selection process. Recently, these systems have been widely applied to the healthcare domain to help both end-users and medical professionals in making more efficient and accurate health related decisions \cite{tran_recommender_2021}. Recommender systems have also been used to provide personalized doctor recommendations based on emotions and preferences of users about doctors through their ratings and reviews \cite{zhang_idoctor_2017}.

There are different recommendation techniques, each with pros and cons. The most famous technique is \ac{cf}. \ac{cf} recommends items to a user based on users similarities learned from all the users interactions. In healthcare, if patients share similar disease profiles / health conditions, \ac{cf} will recommend them similar treatments / healthcare services. Another popular approach is \ac{cb}, which recommends items based on features similarities instead of interactions.

\section{Healthcare-Network web application}

\subsection{Motivation}

With these evidences of healthcare information needs, we developed Healthcare Network, a web application that lists every hospital in France, and displays key statistics on them. The application is directed to either health professionals or patients. Health professionals might use it to gain insights about specific hospitals, and look for the best place to send their patients when they lack expertise. Patients could learn more about the hospital they have been sent to, check the care quality or surgery volume.

\subsection{Data sources}

We gathered the data from three sources: \ac{pmsi} database, \ac{sae} yearly surveys and open data platforms such as \href{https://data.gouv.fr}{data.gouv.fr}.

\subsection{Application features}

In this section, we will describe the most important features of the web application, illustrated with screen captures from the website.

\subsubsection{Search}

The landing page of the application is a minimalist search bar, as illustrated on \cref{fig:hn-home}. The search feature lets the user look for hospitals by name, category or location.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{images/healthcare-network/home.png}
    \centering
    \caption{

    }
    \label{fig:hn-home}
\end{figure}

We now provide a search example, and \cref{fig:hn-search} shows the results of the query ``chu'', corresponding to the \acf{chru} hospital category. 153 results were returned, displayed as a list on the left and on a map on the right side of the screen. The list shows basic informations about the retrieved hospitals, including their names, locations, categories and type of care provided, like \acf{mco} for instance. The map is interactive, and lets the user visualize the spatial distribution of the retrieved hospitals. On the map, the hospitals are displayed as icons, colored by hospital category.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{images/healthcare-network/search.png}
    \centering
    \caption{
        \textbf{Healthcare-Network: search results.} The list of retrieved hospitals and their details is displayed, as their position on a map. This query shows all the \ac{chru} hospitals in metropolitan France.
    }
    \label{fig:hn-search}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Hospital page}

Each hospital has its individual web page, as illustrated on \cref{fig:hn-coulommiers-page} with the \ac{ch} de Coulommiers. The web page shows basic informations about the hospital, with name, location and category displayed first. A navigation pane also shows the hospital \ac{ght} and legal entity. The hospital location is shown on an interactive map. On this map, more indicators can be added:

\begin{itemize}
    \item The municipalities populations and median salary, to gain insight about the hospital neighborhood.
    \item Patients provenance, displaying the number of patients who visited this hospital per municipalities within a year.
    \item Other hospitals from the same \ac{ght}.
    \item Hospitals that shared patients with this hospital within a year.
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[H]
    \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{images/healthcare-network/hospital-page.png}
    \centering
    \caption{
        \textbf{Healthcare-Network: example of an hospital page, \acf{ch} de Coulommiers.} The web page shows basic informations about the hospital, with name, location and category displayed first. A navigation pane also shows the hospital \ac{ght} and legal entity. The hospital location is shown on an interactive map.
    }
    \label{fig:hn-coulommiers-page}
\end{figure}

On \cref{fig:hn-coulommiers-co-occ}, we colored the municipalities by the number of patients who visited \ac{ch} de Coulommiers. We also displayed hospitals from the same legal entity in green. Finally, we show hospitals that exchanged patients with \ac{ch} de Coulommiers as blue links. From this map, we observe that \ac{ch} de Coulommiers mostly attract patients from the neighboring municipalities, and sends patients towards Paris hospitals.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{images/healthcare-network/coulommiers-co-occ.png}
    \centering
    \caption{
        \textbf{Healthcare-Network: example of an hospital page, \acf{ch} de Coulommiers.} We filled the municipalities by the number of patients who visited \ac{ch} de Coulommiers. We also displayed hospitals from the same legal entity in green. Finally, we show hospitals that exchanged patients with \ac{ch} de Coulommiers as blue links.
    }
    \label{fig:hn-coulommiers-co-occ}
\end{figure}

We display the list of services and number of \ac{mco} stays and beds for hospitals, as seen on \cref{fig:hn-curie-services} for the Institut Curie Paris hospital. The list of services allows to quickly evaluate the hospital ability to treat cancer patients. The number of stays and number of beds lets the users evaluate the hospital size, and how saturated it is.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{images/healthcare-network/curie-services.png}
    \centering
    \caption{
        \textbf{Healthcare-Network: description of health services offered, and statistics on \ac{mco} activity for Institut Curie Paris hospital.}
    }
    \label{fig:hn-curie-services}
\end{figure}

Focusing on oncology activity, we show statistics related to cancer care, as illustrated on \cref{fig:hn-curie-cancero}. This section lists the key oncology services like radiotherapy, cancer surgery and chemotherapy authorization. The number of cancer related stays, the number of radiotherapy stays as well as the number of beds dedicated to oncology are shown.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{images/healthcare-network/curie-cancero.png}

    \caption{
        \textbf{Healthcare-Network: description of oncology activity for Institut Curie Paris hospital.}
    }
    \label{fig:hn-curie-cancero}
\end{figure}

Finally, we show the distribution of cancer organs treated by the hospital. The radar chart on \cref{fig:hn-curie-dp} displays the number of patients treated by principal diagnosis, colored in green. The purple curve displays the median number of patients treated for every hospital in the same category, while the orange curve shows the overall median.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{images/healthcare-network/curie-dp.png}
    \centering
    \caption{
        \textbf{Healthcare-Network: number of patients per cancer related diagnosis for Institut Curie Paris hospital.} Comparison with the median statistics from hospitals within the same category (\ac{clcc}) and overall median.
    }
    \label{fig:hn-curie-dp}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Statistics on municipalities}

To gain insights about the hospital neighborhood, we show socio-demographic statistics on the municipality where the hospital is located. In the case of Institut Curie, the municipality is the 5\textsuperscript{th} arrondissement of Paris. Among the numbers displayed, we have the municipality size, population, median salary and poverty rate. We also count the number of health professionals by occupation within the hospital department, and within the hospital. This gives information on the link between the hospital and the town medicine which is very important for patient care.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{images/healthcare-network/curie-commune.png}
    \centering
    \caption{
        \textbf{Healthcare-Network: statistics on the municipality where Institut Curie Paris is located (Paris 75105).} Population, median salary and accessibility to primary care are displayed to qualify the hospital neighborhood. Health professionals within the department are also listed to illustrate the health supply available around the hospital.

\section{Discussion}

\subsubsection{Expected benefits}

\subsubsection{Disparities in access to information}

Although the current literature has shown many benefits of HRS to improve their health conditions, there still exist some gaps regarding developing and evaluating HRS that need to be bridged. Typically, the evaluation of recommender systems emphasizes the accuracy metrics. However, in the healthcare domain, recommender systems' quality needs to be measured based on aspects beyond the accuracy objectives (Valdez et al. 2016). Trust is one of the most important criteria that should be considered when evaluating recommender systems. This aspect can be enhanced by providing explanations for recommendations. Privacy is referred to as the ability of HRS to preserve patients' preferences and medical information. The principle of ``first do no harm'' should be kept in mind when developing HRS to minimize potential risks and maximize benefits for users. In HRS, it would make sense to investigate the relationship between health-related recommendations and users' satisfaction from different user groups, e.g., patients, doctors, nurses, physicians, and medical researchers. Uncertainty in HRS links to potential risks, such as imprecise predictions since user preferences are not always captured well, or the inability to find a perfect pattern because of incomplete data. The risks could result in a reduced quality of the patient's life.

However, while mass media communications can be an important source of health information, research found social disparities in health knowledge that may be related to media use. Indeed, cancer-related health communications seems to be patterned by race, ethnicity, language, and social class. The benefits of health information are not equally distributed across socially distinct groups in the United States \cite{viswanath_race_2011}. Moreover, a lower likelihood of cancer information seeking was also observed among those with lower education levels, lower income and greater ages \cite{finney_rutten_cancer-related_2016}.
