\section{Information seeking}

% Cancer information is important
When diagnosed with cancer patients and their family members lives change radically. They receive treatments and have to make choices with serious consequences. Such diseases and treatments are complex, but should be understood before decisions are made. Patients and their family members should be provided with intelligible and up to date information on the stage of disease, treatment options and complementary therapies \cite{butow_dynamics_1997,cassileth_information_1980}. Involving cancer patients in decision-making on their pathways improves their satisfaction and quality of life \cite{sheabudgell_information_2014}. On the contrary, patients who need health information but experience difficulties are at risk of experiencing poorer psychosocial health \cite{arora_barriers_2002}.

Carefully designed communication interventions have an impact on the patient's knowledge and recall, patient satisfaction and their ability to manage the symptoms \cite{johnson_effects_1982,hack_feasibility_1999,mohide_randomised_1996,mcpherson_effective_2001}. Some evidence indicates that preparing patients ahead of time for the clinical visit by providing practical information has a beneficial effect \cite{huchcroft_testing_1984,cegala_patient_2003}.

The demonstrated benefits of information seeking for cancer patients, coupled with increases in information availability, underscore the importance of monitoring patient information seeking experiences over time \cite{finney_rutten_cancer-related_2016}.

Communication facilitates the patients involvement in their own healthcare, reduces distress, improves adherence to, and compliance with, treatment regimens and increases the patient's sense of control \cite{viswanath_science_2005}.

Considerable research shows that medically related education interventions are most effective when they are tailored to patients' individual needs. While this matter is relevant to all patient communication skills training, it may be especially relevant to cancer patients \cite{cegala_patient_2003}.

% The communications revolution
The way we communicate and interact with information has drastically changed in the past years. We see more and more data from different sources generated each day, combined with a proliferation in the number of information delivery platforms. A large number of people now have smartphones that allow them to access information and the time or place they want. Consequently, we notice several shifts in how people access and use information. First, mass audience is fragmented into more closely aligned smaller groups who share common characteristics and interests. Additionally, there has been a shift in audience media use patterns, with the growth of the online audience far outpacing those for other media. It is now easy to access technical reports, scientific articles, and consensus guidelines, as they are available on many websites open to anyone with an Internet access. While these materials may not always be intended for a mainstream audience, their availability offers opportunities for access and interpretation by different groups \cite{viswanath_communications_2012}.

% Growing quantity of information available
The quantity of cancer information available in the media and on the internet has been growing rapidly over the past decades \cite{viswanath_science_2005,viswanath_communications_2012}, changing how patients interact with providers based on advice and input from peers and family members. Communication has been found to play a central role in cancer prevention and control. It can provide information on cancer prevention, monitor lifestyles and health behaviors, promote participatory decision making during cancer detection, diagnosis, and treatment, and foster quality of life during survivorship or end of life  \cite{viswanath_communications_2012}.

% Patients are looking for information
As a matter of fact, patients are often seeking information during their pathways. In the United States of America, a survey from the Health Information National Trends (HINTS) \cite{hesse_trust_2005} measured online health activities, levels of trust, and source preference for 6,369 people. They showed that 63.7\% of the online population in the US looked for health information for themselves or others. Although an increasing number of patients were looking for information online, physicians remained the most trusted source of information.

% How do patients get their information ?
A Canadian study surveyed patients attending appointments at follow-up cancer clinics in Calgary, Alberta \cite{sheabudgell_information_2014} between 2011 and 2012. They approached 648 patients and obtained responses from 411 one of them. The study aimed at: identifying information needs of patients when meeting their physician for a follow-up; listing patients preferences on how to receive information. Here are the results they gathered regarding information seeking patterns. The most frequently reported source of information was the Internet (57.4\%); health provider (32.6\%), brochures or pamphlets (25.1\%), and cancer organizations (24.3\%). The most frequently reported types of information sought included information about a specific type of cancer (43.1\%), treatment or cures for cancer (29.4\%), prognosis or recovery from cancer (29.0\%), and prevention of cancer (27.0\%). The least frequently reported types of cancer information sought included where to get medical care (3.4\%), paying for medical care or insurance (4.6\%), and cancer organizations (5.4\%). Regarding trust, the physician or health care provider was largely the most trusted source of information, followed by Internet, and family and friends. The least trusted sources of information included radio, newspaper, and television.

% Patients are not always satisfied with the amount of information they receive
Despite actively looking for information, there is increasing evidence that patients with cancer require more information about their disease and its consequences than they receive \cite{mcpherson_effective_2001}.

Moreover, studies shown that patients are often not satisfied with the information they receive, or forget or misunderstand the information conveyed \cite{ley_communicating_1988,hogbin_getting_1989}. The interaction with their physician has also been cited as a major cause of dissatisfaction \cite{stewart_effective_1995,bartlett_effects_1984} at all stages of illness \cite{higginson_palliative_1990}. Patients reported insufficient time spent on communication during the clinical encounter and physicians inability to keep up with the most current information and advances in cancer care \cite{anderson_impact_2003}.

% Internet to help patients
As a result of this dissatisfaction with information and communication with their physician, patients have started to search for health information and resources on the internet \cite{chen_impact_2001,pereira_internet_2000,ziebland_how_2004,dolce_internet_2011}. Research has been conveyed to better understand the relationship between physicians and cancer patients, and how they used the internet as a source of health information \cite{dolce_internet_2011}. An online questionnaire was administered to participants of cancer-related communities hosted by the Association of Cancer Online Resources (ACOR). As a result, 488 participants shared their personal experiences with accessing health online resources. Several participants reported not receiving the most up-to-date cancer information from their physician. Diagnostic failures in which symptoms had been undiagnosed, incorrectly diagnosed, or dismissed by their healthcare provider also happened for some patients. This is especially true for rare cancers and unusual side effects. Patients who encountered physicians with lack of clinical expertise consequently turned to the Internet to fill the information gap. For instance, participants who experienced a lack of informational support related to procedures found blogs and testimonies online that helped them to know what to expect from a physical and emotional perspective. Sometimes, for rare diseases, physicians can benefit from patients looking from additional information online, as it may bring additional knowledge to them, and even change their plans for care. Aware patients can also challenge their physicians by asking meaningful questions and participate in the tailoring of their treatment plans. Finally, online communities allowed patients to identify physicians with a proven track record in cancer care. They endorsed care providers who took the time to answer questions, as well as specialists from major cancer centers, that brought superior care which led to better outcome.

The increased usage of the Internet by cancer patients thus puts new demands on health care professionals. Patients need advice about how to find reliable and credible web sites and also help with authenticating and interpreting the information they find \cite{carlsson_cancer_2009}.

% Hospital recommender system
Nowadays, a vast amount of clinical data scattered across different sites on the Internet hinders users from finding helpful information for their well-being improvement. Besides, the overload of medical information (e.g., on drugs, medical tests, and treatment suggestions) have brought many difficulties to medical professionals in making patient-oriented decisions. These issues raise the need to apply recommender systems in the healthcare domain to help both, end-users and medical professionals, make more efficient and accurate health related decisions \cite{tran_recommender_2021}. Recommender systems have been integrated into online retailers, streaming services, and social networks to facilitate users' item selection process. Recently, these systems have been widely applied to the healthcare domain to better support medical suggestions.

In e-commerce domains, people might naively think that the ``most preferred items'' are more likely to be recommended to users. However, this idea needs to be reconsidered in the healthcare domain since items that are the best for this user might not be good for others. HRS are able to support two types of users: end-users and healthcare professionals. End-users could be healthy users or patients. HRS can offer recommendations concerning different categories, such as diets to optimize nutrition, physical activities/sports that match the user's requirements and needs, recommended diagnoses of patients to doctors or nurses, treatments/medications for a specific disease, and medical information/sources that motivate(s) users to follow a healthy lifestyle and improve their well-being (Valdez et al. 2016).

Recommendation techniques:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Collaborative Filtering (CF): CF recommends items to a user based on the following idea: If users shared the same interests in the past, then they would have similar tastes. In the context of HRS, this approach can be interpreted as follows: If patients share similar disease profiles/health conditions, then they would have similar treatments/healthcare services.
    \item Content-based Filtering (CB): This approach looks for items similar to those that the user liked in the past and match the user profile. In HRS, this approach suggests healthcare services that fit the patient's health condition/disease situation and are similar to those assigned to him/her in the past.
    \item Knowledge-based Recommendation (KB): This approach creates recommendations based on knowledge about the items, explicit user preferences, and a set of constraints describing the dependencies between users' preferences and items' properties.
    \item Hybrid Recommendation (HyR): The idea of this approach is to combine the aforementioned recommendation techniques to make use of the advantages of one approach and fix the disadvantages of another approach.
\end{itemize}

In recent years, there has been a significant increase in the amount of available medical information, which results in some difficulties for patients when searching for suitable doctors. What concerns patients greatly is how to find medical professionals with the best expertise for resolving their health issues \cite{narducci_recommender_2015, hoens_reliable_2010}. This gap raises an open topic on patient-doctor matchmaking, in which patients can find the right doctors to build a trust relationship \cite{han_hybrid_2018}.
Zhang et al. \cite{zhang_idoctor_2017} proposed an iDoctor system to provide users with personalized doctor recommendations. This system explores the emotions and preferences of users about doctors through their ratings and reviews.

% Hospital recommender system potential issues
Although the current literature has shown many benefits of HRS to improve their health conditions, there still exist some gaps regarding developing and evaluating HRS that need to be bridged. Typically, the evaluation of recommender systems emphasizes the accuracy metrics. However, in the healthcare domain, recommender systems' quality needs to be measured based on aspects beyond the accuracy objectives (Valdez et al. 2016). Trust is one of the most important criteria that should be considered when evaluating recommender systems. This aspect can be enhanced by providing explanations for recommendations. Privacy is referred to as the ability of HRS to preserve patients' preferences and medical information. The principle of ``first do no harm'' should be kept in mind when developing HRS to minimize potential risks and maximize benefits for users. In HRS, it would make sense to investigate the relationship between health-related recommendations and users' satisfaction from different user groups, e.g., patients, doctors, nurses, physicians, and medical researchers. Uncertainty in HRS links to potential risks, such as imprecise predictions since user preferences are not always captured well, or the inability to find a perfect pattern because of incomplete data. The risks could result in a reduced quality of the patient's life.

% Disparities in information accessibility
However, while mass media communications can be an important source of health information, research found social disparities in health knowledge that may be related to media use. Indeed, cancer-related health communications seems to be patterned by race, ethnicity, language, and social class. The benefits of health information are not equally distributed across socially distinct groups in the United States \cite{viswanath_race_2011}. Moreover, a lower likelihood of cancer information seeking was also observed among those with lower education levels, lower income and greater ages \cite{finney_rutten_cancer-related_2016}.

% Importance of quality in surgery
% TODO

It is becoming increasingly clear that surgeon volume affects surgical outcomes. High-volume surgeons demonstrate reduced peri-operative complications, shorter operative times, and reduced blood loss during multiple modalities of benign gynecologic surgery. Furthermore, high volume surgeons consistently demonstrate higher rates of minimally-invasive approaches, low rates of conversion to laparotomy, and lower per-procedure case costs. Additionally, surgeons may have an ethical obligation to inform patients of their surgical volume and outcomes, with options for referrals if needed \cite{glaser_surgeon_2019}.

Surgeon and hospital-related factors directly influence the surgeon learning curve and are therefore rightly considered predictors of outcome in colorectal cancer surgery. A low surgeon or hospital caseload may be compensated by intensified supervision or by improved training and teaching \cite{bonati_surgeon_2021}

The surgeon's learning curve is therefore directly related to the patient's outcome.. Improvements in supervision, training/teaching, specialization, the surgeon's caseload, and the hospital's caseload will therefore translate into enhanced patient outcome \cite{renzulli_learning_2005}.

High surgeon's and hospital's annual caseloads are strong, independent prognostic factors for extending overall and disease-free survival and reducing the rate of local recurrence in 2 randomized colorectal cancer trials \cite{renzulli_influence_2006}.

Good outcome for patients with adenocarcinoma of the rectum who undergo neoadjuvant external beam radiotherapy and proctectomy is associated with subspecialty training in colon and rectal surgery \cite{read_surgeon_2002}.

Patients managed by high-volume surgeons were more likely to have breast-conserving surgery (BCS) than those managed by low-volume surgeons. Even in a setting with established quality control measures (KPIs) surgeon and unit volume have potent influences on initial patient management and treatment \cite{mcdermott_surgeon_2013}.

Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is the standard of care for axillary staging in patients with clinically node-negative breast cancer. Patients who receive treatment from surgeons with more experience with and focus on breast cancer are significantly more likely to undergo SLNB, highlighting the importance of receiving initial treatment by specialized providers \cite{yen_surgeon_2014}.

Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease and is best treated by a multidisciplinary specialist team. Case volume and expertise clearly affect outcomes and women treated by specialist surgeons are more likely to receive guideline-adherent therapy with better oncological outcomes. Quality indicators (QIs) for breast cancer care have been developed and applied in high income countries and contributed to improved quality of care and patient outcomes over time. A regional set of QIs was developed to facilitate standardized treatment and auditing of surgical care for breast cancer patients in South Africa. Routine monitoring of the ten mandatory QIs, which were selected to have the most substantial impact on patient outcome, is proposed \cite{nietz_quality_2020}.
