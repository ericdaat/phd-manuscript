\chapter{Accessibility to oncology care}

\section{Context}

\subsection{Motivation}

While a lot of the ongoing research is focusing on finding new cancer treatments, accessibility to oncology care receives less attention. Yet, several studies have showed that access to health services plays a key role in cancer survival. For instance, geographic residency status and social environment seem to explain treatment and prognosis disparities for patients with non-small cell lung cancer \cite{johnson_treatment_2014}. In France, increases in travel times to health services were associated with lower survival rates for patients with a colorectal cancer \cite{dejardin_influence_2014}. In New Zealand, living in deprived areas, far from a cancer center or from primary care was associated with lower survival chances for patients with colorectal, lung and prostate cancers \cite{haynes_cancer_2008}.

\subsection{Accessibility definition}

Accessibility refers to the relative ease by which services can be reached from a given location \cite{wang_measurement_2012}. Accessibility can be defined by spatial factors, determined by where you are; and non-spatial factors, determined by who you are \cite{khan_integrated_1992}. Spatial accessibility methods assess the availability of supply locations from demand locations, connected by a travel impedance metric. Supply locations are characterized by their capacity or quantity of available resource. Similarly, demand locations are characterized by their population. Such methods have been successfully used to measure access to healthcare, such as primary care \cite{guagliardo_spatial_2004} or oncology care \cite{wang_measurement_2012,zahnd_spatial_2021,alahmadi_spatial_2013} in several countries including France \cite{launay_methodology_2019,gusmano_disparities_2014,gao_assessment_2016}. In what follows, we restrict accessibility to spatial accessibility and use both terms interchangeably.

\subsection{Spatial accessibility methods}

There are several ways to compute accessibility to healthcare \cite{guagliardo_spatial_2004}. The easiest and most straightforward methods are computed within bordered areas, like provider-to-population ratios in each municipality. While they are very intuitive, these methods do not account for border crossing, or travel impedance, which makes them less accurate. Recently, a new type of method has been developed and is now used in most spatial accessibility papers. This algorithm is called \ac{2sfca} \cite{luo_using_2004}. It is a two-step method that first computes a provider-to-population ratio for each provider location. In the second step, for each population location, an accessibility score is obtained by summing the provider-to-population ratios. For the algorithm to work, a catchment threshold (distance or travel time) must be set. Above this threshold, a provider location is considered unreachable from the population location, and vice versa. The \ac{2sfca} method does not account for distance decay: a care center is either reachable or not. The \ac{e2sfca} \cite{luo_enhanced_2009} addresses this limitation by applying weights to differentiate travel zones in both steps.

\section{Methods}

We now explain more formally how to compute \ac{e2sfca} scores. Consider $P_i$ the population at location $i$, with $1 \leq i \leq n$ where n is the number of population locations. Similarly, consider $S_u$ the capacity of care center $u$, with $1 \leq u \leq m$ where $m$ is the number of care centers. Finally, let $d_{iu}$ be the matrix of size $n \times m$ containing the distances between location i and care center u. We consider r sub-catchment zones each associated with a weight $W_s$, and a distance $D_s$, with $1 \leq s \leq r$, such that $D_1 D_2 < ... < D_r$ and $W_1 > W_2 > ... > W_r$. The resulting r travel intervals are $I_1=[0, D_1], I_2=[D_1, D_2 ], ... ,I_r=[D_{r-1}-,D_r]$. The accessibility $A_i$ of a population location $i$ is computed in two steps:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Step 1: for every care center $u$, compute its weighted capacity-to-population ratio $R_u$.

    \begin{equation}
    R_u =  \frac{S_u}{\sum_{s=1}^{r} W_s \sum_{i, d_{iu} \in I_s} P_i}
    \end{equation}

    \item Step 2: for every population location, compute $A_i$ as the sum all the weighted $R_u$ of the reachable care centers.

    \begin{equation}
    A_i = \sum_{s=1}^{r} W_s \sum_{u, d_{iu} \in I_s} R_u
    \end{equation}
\end{itemize}
\section{Results}

We computed the spatial accessibility score to these care centers for every municipality in metropolitan France, using the \ac{e2sfca} algorithm and oncology activity as supply variable. We compared the accessibility distributions with \ac{e2sfca} vs. regular \ac{2sfca}. The accessibility was lower with \ac{e2sfca} because of the weight decay. We also studied the influence of the supply variable in the accessibility score. Accessibility is much higher if we use the number of \ac{mco} stays as supply, instead of the oncology activity. This makes sense since oncology care centers are less common and the overall \ac{mco} activity is higher than the oncology activity.

The oncology accessibility is unevenly distributed across the country, as displayed on \cref{fig:accessibility-france}. For better readability, we cut the accessibility scores into 5 quantiles. Q5 colored in dark green contains the top 20\% accessibility municipalities, and Q1 in light yellow contains the bottom 20\% ones. The lowest accessibility zones are mostly located in the center of the country and in mountainous regions like the Alps or the Pyrenees. Plot (B) shows that most of the population (51.6\%) lives in top 20\% accessibility municipalities, while 6.3\% lives in the bottom 20\% quantile. On map (A), care centers are displayed as squares, colored by cluster index, and sized by oncology activity. We see that accessibility is highest near the most specialized care centers. Indeed, the proportion of care centers from specialized clusters decreases in lower accessibility quantiles (C). We then ranked the departments by median accessibility and showed the top-10 and bottom 10 on plot (D). Among the top-5 departments, 4 are in Ile-de-France. Departments from the bottom-10 are rural or mountainous areas like Lozère and Alpes-de-Haute-Provence.  We notice disparities within departments as well, as outlined by the large interquartile range in Hérault or Alpes-Maritimes. On the contrary, this spread is very narrow in Ile-de-France departments.

Accessibility score should be put into perspective with population density. Overall, the denser municipalities have a median accessibility around 0.02. Municipalities with low population densities have more extreme values.  \cref{fig:accessibility-vs-density} compares accessibility and population density for three different regions: Provence-Alpes-Cote-d'Azur (A), Ile-de-France (B), and Bourgogne-Franche-Comté (C). Municipalities are displayed as squares, colored by accessibility quantile, and sized by population density. These regions show very different profiles. In Provence-Alpes-Cote-d'Azur (A), accessibility is essentially low in non-dense municipalities near the Alps. However, in Bourgogne-Franche-Comté (C), we see dense municipalities with poor accessibility scores, representing a large proportion of the region. We also drew similar maps (D, E and F) where municipalities are colored based on the average travel du-ration for patients with cancer in 2018. We see that the average travel time is higher in municipalities with poor accessibility scores.

\end{figure}

Finally, we compared our accessibility score with the department exit ratio, by municipality. Department exit ratio is defined as the proportion of cancer patients who visited a care center outside from their department of residence and was computed using the \ac{pmsi} database. In Provence-Alpes-Cote-d'Azur, the exit ratio is higher in departments with low accessibility scores and few oncology specialized care centers, as in Alpes-de-Haute-Provence and Hautes-Alpes. While the Var department has some oncology centers, exit ratio remains high since larger care centers are in Marseille and Nice.

\subsection*{Provence-Alpes-Cote-d'Azur}

We now focus on the region Provence-Alpes-Cote-d'Azur. This region is the far southeastern on the mainland. The region's population was 5,048 million in 2018. Its prefecture and largest city is Marseille. The region contains six departments. Bouches-du-Rhone, Var and Alpes-Maritimes are located on the coastline and gather the largest cities like Marseille, Nice, or Toulon. Alpes-de-Haute-Provence, Vaucluse, and Hautes-Alpes are inland departments, with a majority of rural and mountainous areas. Results are shown on \cref{fig:accessibility-paca}. By comparing maps (A) and (B), we confirm that the accessibility is maximum in denser areas of the region. Average patients travel time are displayed on map (C) and we drew the major roads (primary, motorway and truck) in red. The road system is well developed on the coast, rallying the larger cities of the region. However, driving from the rural areas in the Alps to the major cities is hard, resulting in higher travel times. The accessibility is unevenly spread within the departments, especially in Alpes-Maritimes where the distribution is multi-modal (D). There, cities like Nice and Cannes have large hospitals thus good accessibility, while the northern areas of the department are mostly mountains. Accessibility is higher in municipalities with dense populations, for all the departments (E). Finally, the average travel time decreases when the accessibility score increases. This makes sense since the accessibility score was computed based on the driving distance between population locations and care centers. However, it confirms that patients living in poor accessibility zones effectively travel further to seek oncology care. In Bouches-du-Rhone, nearly all the municipalities have an average travel time lower than 30 minutes, while in Alpes-de-Haute-Provence, average travel times are rarely lower than 60 minutes (F).

\section{Discussion}

Specific attention should be given to municipalities with very poor access to oncology care centers. While we saw that most of the population lives in high accessibility areas, around 6\% of the population lives in the bottom 20\% accessibility quantile. Among these municipalities, some are very rural and mountainous like those in the Alpes-de-Haute-Provence in Provence-Alpes-Cote-d'Azur region. Such areas cannot be expected to have a very good healthcare cover-age. By contrast, the case of suburban areas with relatively dense population and poor accessibility should be addressed more easily. Our optimization algorithm can help driving public health policies, as it effectively identifies areas where accessibility could grow, by allocating additional oncology activity to a restricted number of care centers. The proposed growth factors are indicative and do not have to be effective within a year, as it represents a considerable effort for care centers to increase their activity.
Our oncology accessibility score is deliberately non-specific to cancer type. This score is meant to outline how easy it would be for a population location to reach a first entry point for oncology care. Here, we are only focusing on surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy treatments. The same technique could be used on a specific cancer type, the method will remain the same, only the supply variable used in the accessibility score will change. We should mention that spatial accessibility is better suited for pathologies that are relatively well handled across the whole country. Accessibility for rare diseases like pediatric cancer or complex cancers that re-quire a specific expertise is less informative because only a handful of care centers are indicated.
Similarly, we could compute an accessibility score that is focused on specific kinds of stays: our web application lets the user pick between surgery, chemotherapy, or radiotherapy as supply variable.
