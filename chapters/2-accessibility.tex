\chapter{Accessibility to oncology care}

\section{Context}

\subsection{Motivation}

While a lot of the ongoing research is focusing on finding new cancer treatments, accessibility to oncology care receives less attention. Yet, several studies have showed that access to health services plays a key role in cancer survival. For instance, geographic residency status and social environment seem to explain treatment and prognosis disparities for patients with non-small cell lung cancer \cite{johnson_treatment_2014}. In France, increases in travel times to health services were associated with lower survival rates for patients with a colorectal cancer \cite{dejardin_influence_2014}. In New Zealand, living in deprived areas, far from a cancer center or from primary care was associated with lower survival chances for patients with colorectal, lung and prostate cancers \cite{haynes_cancer_2008}.

\subsection{Accessibility definition}

Accessibility refers to the relative ease by which services can be reached from a given location \cite{wang_measurement_2012}. Accessibility can be defined by spatial factors, determined by where you are; and non-spatial factors, determined by who you are \cite{khan_integrated_1992}. \ac{sa} methods assess the availability of supply locations from demand locations, connected by a travel impedance metric. Supply locations are characterized by their capacity or quantity of available resource. Similarly, demand locations are characterized by their population. Such methods have been successfully used to measure access to healthcare, such as primary care \cite{guagliardo_spatial_2004} or oncology care \cite{wang_measurement_2012,zahnd_spatial_2021,alahmadi_spatial_2013} in several countries including France \cite{launay_methodology_2019,gusmano_disparities_2014,gao_assessment_2016}. In what follows, we restrict accessibility to \acf{sa} and use both terms interchangeably.

\subsection{\acf{sa} methods}

There are several ways to compute accessibility to healthcare as reviewed in \cite{guagliardo_spatial_2004}. We detail these methods in the following sections.

\subsubsection{Provider-to-population ratios}

% Definition
The easiest and most straightforward \ac{sa} method is to compute provider-to-population ratios, also referred as supply ratios. The ratio involves some indicator of health service capacity (supply) as numerator; while the denominator is the population size within the area (demand). For instance, when measuring accessibility to primary care, one might use the number of physicians in the area as supply, and area population as demand. The resulting ratio might be interpreted as the number of physicians per 100,000 inhabitants \cite{schonfeld_numbers_1972}.

% Pros
Supply ratios are highly interpretable, and relevant for comparisons of supply in large areas. Policy analysts have used these metrics to set minimal standards of supply and identify under-served areas where supply should be increased  \cite{schonfeld_numbers_1972,council_on_graduate_medical_education_physician_1998,connor_competition_1995}

% Cons
However, supply ratios have limitations that often prevent their usage in more detailed analysis. First, they do not account for patient border crossing, which commonly occurs for small areas \cite{connor_measuring_1994,basu_border-crossing_1996,basu_medicare_1995,holahan_border_1993}. Second, supply ratios are constant within the bordered area, which will lead to imprecision and false generalization in large areas. Finally, they do not consider travel impedance, which plays a major role in \ac{sa}. Consequently the results and interpretations can vary greatly depending on the size, number and configuration of the areal units studied. This problem is well-known to geographers and spatial analysts as the modifiable areal unit problem (MAUP) \cite{openshaw_modifiable_1983}.

\subsubsection{Travel impedance to providers}

% Definition
As stated earlier, travel impedance is a key aspect of \ac{sa} evaluation. It is typically measured from a patient's residence or from the centroid of a population location when the precise location is not available. The impedance can be expressed in different ways: euclidean (straight) distance, travel distance or estimated travel time.

% Pros
Travel impedance is suited for rural areas, where providers are limited and patients often travel to the nearest choice available.

% Cons
However, travel impedance is less relevant for urban areas. Indeed, there are numerous reasonable options available at a similar distance and patients won't travel to the closest one anymore. Moreover, travel impedance is a poor indicator of availability and should be combined with supply to properly evaluate \ac{sa} \cite{fryer_multi-method_1999}.

\subsubsection{Gravity models}

% Definition
Gravity models are more sophisticated ways to evaluate \ac{sa}, based on a modified version of Newton's Law of Gravitation. They were initially developed to predict retail travel \cite{reilly_law_1931} and help with land use planning \cite{hansen_how_1959}. Gravity models combine both accessibility and availability, and work well in urban and rural settings. Gravity models represent the influence of all service points located within a reasonable distance from a population location. The influence is discounted by the increasing distance or travel impedance. The simplest formula for gravity-based accessibility is:

\begin{equation}
    A_i = \sum_j \frac{S_j}{d_{ij}^{\beta}}
\end{equation}

In this equation, $A_i$ is the accessibility score at population location $i$. $S_j$ is the capacity of the service point $j$, and $d_{ij}$ the travel impedance (e.g. distance or travel time) between population location $i$ and service point $j$. We set $\beta$ as a gravity decay coefficient, sometimes referred to as the travel friction coefficient. Intuitively, $\beta$ represents the change in difficulty of travel as the impedance value increases. The accessibility score increases with higher provider capacity, and decreases with higher travel impedance. Gravity models are an elegant way to compute accessibility, which accounts for border crossing, local variations, and travel impedance.

% Cons
The main drawbacks of this approach is the lack of intuitiveness, and healthcare policy makers prefer to think of \ac{sa} in terms of provider-to-population ratios or simple distance. Second, it only models supply and does not account for demand. Providers should not be equally accessible if they serve population locations with drastically different population sizes.
A proposed solution is to add a population demand factor $V_j$, to the denominator \cite{joseph_measuring_1982}:

\begin{equation}
    V_j = \sum_k \frac{P_k}{d_{kj}^{\beta}}
\end{equation}

Here, $P_k$ is the population size at population location $k$, and $d_{kj}$ is the distance between the population location $k$ and provider location $j$. Intuitively, the demand on provider location $j$ is obtained by summing the gravity discounted influence of all population points within a reasonable distance. The improved gravity model is:

\begin{equation}
    A_i = \sum_j \frac{S_j}{d_{ij}^{\beta} V_j}
\end{equation}

However, another problem is that the distance decay coefficient, $\beta$, is usually unknown and hard to estimate. Its form and magnitude can vary greatly with the service type and population under study \cite{talen_assessing_1998}.

\subsubsection{\acf{2sfca}}

Recently, a new type of method has been developed and is now used in most \ac{sa} papers. This algorithm is called \ac{2sfca} \cite{luo_using_2004}. It is a two-step method that first computes a provider-to-population ratio for each provider location. In the second step, for each population location, an accessibility score is obtained by summing the provider-to-population ratios. For the algorithm to work, a catchment threshold (distance or travel time) must be set. Above this threshold, a provider location is considered unreachable from the population location, and vice versa.

\subsubsection{\acf{e2sfca}}

The \ac{2sfca} method does not account for distance decay: a provider is either reachable or not. The \ac{e2sfca} \cite{luo_enhanced_2009} addresses this limitation by applying weights to differentiate travel zones in both steps.

Consider $P_i$ the population at location $i$, with $1 \leq i \leq n$ where $n$ is the number of population locations. Similarly, consider $S_u$ the capacity of care center $u$, with $1 \leq u \leq m$ where $m$ is the number of care centers. Finally, let $d_{iu}$ be the matrix of size $n \times m$ containing the distances between location $i$ and providers $u$. We consider $r$ sub-catchment zones each associated with a weight $W_s$, and a distance $D_s$, with $1 \leq s \leq r$, such that $D_1 < D_2 < ... < D_r$ and $W_1 > W_2 > ... > W_r$. The resulting r travel intervals are $I_1=[0, D_1], I_2=[D_1, D_2 ], ... ,I_r=[D_{r-1}-,D_r]$. The accessibility $A_i$ of a population location $i$ is computed in two steps:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Step 1: for every care center $u$, compute its weighted capacity-to-population ratio $R_u$.
    \item Step 2: for every population location, compute $A_i$ as the sum all the weighted $R_u$ of the reachable providers.
\end{itemize}

\begin{align}
    R_u & =  \frac{S_u}{\sum_{s=1}^{r} W_s \sum_{i, d_{iu} \in I_s} P_i} \\
    A_i & = \sum_{s=1}^{r} W_s \sum_{u, d_{iu} \in I_s} R_u
\end{align}

\subsubsection{Multi modal \acl{2sfca}}

The \ac{e2sfca} methodology can be enhanced by incorporating both public and private transport modes \cite{langford_multi-modal_2016}. The proposed model yields separate accessibility scores for each modal group at each demand point to better reflect the differential accessibility levels experienced by each cohort.

Suppose that each method of travel (car, bus, walking, etc.) necessitates a dedicated transport network and let each such network be referred to as $N_1, N_2, ..., N_M$. In order to accommodate independent networks for each travel mode into the \ac{e2sfca} model, the computation of Step 1 becomes:

\begin{equation}
    R_u =  \frac{S_u}{\sum_{m=1}^{M} \sum_{s=1}^{r} W_{s,m} \sum_{i, d_{iu,m} \in I_s} P_{i,m}} \\
\end{equation}

Similarly for Step 2:

\begin{equation}
    A_i = \sum_{m=1}^{M} \sum_{s=1}^{r} W_{s, m} \sum_{u, d_{iu} \in I_s} R_u
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Huff model and \acl{2sfca}}

The \ac{e2sfca} does not consider competition among multiple healthcare sites available for a population location \cite{wan_three-step_2012}, and therefore it may lead to overestimation for some sites \cite{luo_integrating_2014}. The Huff Model is a widely accepted method for quantifying the probability of people's selection on a service site out of multiple available ones \cite{huff_probabilistic_1963}. It specifically aims to estimate/model people's choice on a service site with two factors: (1) distance to the service site; and (2) the attraction of the service site.

\begin{equation}
    Prob_{i,j} = \frac{C_i d_{ij}^{-\beta}}{\sum_{s \in D_0} C_s d_{is}^{-\beta}}
\end{equation}

Where:

\begin{itemize}
    \item $Prob_{i,j}$ is the probability of population location $i$ visiting service site $j$
    \item $d_{ij}$ is the travel time between $i$ and $j$
    \item $\beta$ is the distance impedance coefficient
    \item $C_j$ is the capacity \/ attractiveness of service site $j$
    \item $s$ is any service site within the catchment $D_0$ of $i$
\end{itemize}

Incorporating into the \ac{e2sfca} steps gives:

\begin{align}
    R_u & =  \frac{S_u}{\sum_{s=1}^{r} W_s \sum_{i, d_{iu} \in I_s} Prob_{i,u} P_i} \\
    A_i & = \sum_{s=1}^{r} W_s \sum_{u, d_{iu} \in I_s} Prob_{i,u} R_u
\end{align}

\section{Methods}

We computed the \ac{sa} score to these care centers for every municipality in metropolitan France, using the \ac{e2sfca} algorithm and oncology activity as supply variable. We compared the accessibility distributions with \ac{e2sfca} vs. regular \ac{2sfca}. The accessibility was lower with \ac{e2sfca} because of the weight decay. We also studied the influence of the supply variable in the accessibility score. Accessibility is much higher if we use the number of \ac{mco} stays as supply, instead of the oncology activity. This makes sense since oncology care centers are less common and the overall \ac{mco} activity is higher than the oncology activity.

\section{Results}

The oncology accessibility is unevenly distributed across the country, as displayed on \cref{fig:accessibility-france}. For better readability, we cut the accessibility scores into 5 quantiles. Q5 colored in dark green contains the top 20\% accessibility municipalities, and Q1 in light yellow contains the bottom 20\% ones. The lowest accessibility zones are mostly located in the center of the country and in mountainous regions like the Alps or the Pyrenees. Plot (B) shows that most of the population (51.6\%) lives in top 20\% accessibility municipalities, while 6.3\% lives in the bottom 20\% quantile. On map (A), care centers are displayed as squares, colored by cluster index, and sized by oncology activity. We see that accessibility is highest near the most specialized care centers. Indeed, the proportion of care centers from specialized clusters decreases in lower accessibility quantiles (C). We then ranked the departments by median accessibility and showed the top-10 and bottom 10 on plot (D). Among the top-5 departments, 4 are in Ile-de-France. Departments from the bottom-10 are rural or mountainous areas like Lozère and Alpes-de-Haute-Provence.  We notice disparities within departments as well, as outlined by the large interquartile range in Hérault or Alpes-Maritimes. On the contrary, this spread is very narrow in Ile-de-France departments.

\end{figure}

Accessibility score should be put into perspective with population density. Overall, the denser municipalities have a median accessibility around 0.02. Municipalities with low population densities have more extreme values.  \cref{fig:accessibility-vs-density} compares accessibility and population density for three different regions: Provence-Alpes-Cote-d'Azur (A), Ile-de-France (B), and Bourgogne-Franche-Comté (C). Municipalities are displayed as squares, colored by accessibility quantile, and sized by population density. These regions show very different profiles. In Provence-Alpes-Cote-d'Azur (A), accessibility is essentially low in non-dense municipalities near the Alps. However, in Bourgogne-Franche-Comté (C), we see dense municipalities with poor accessibility scores, representing a large proportion of the region. We also drew similar maps (D, E and F) where municipalities are colored based on the average travel duration for patients with cancer in 2018. We see that the average travel time is higher in municipalities with poor accessibility scores.

Municipalities are drawn as squares, sized by population density and colored by either accessibility quantile (A, B, C) or patient average travel time (D, E, F).
    }
    \label{fig:accessibility-vs-density}
\end{figure}

Finally, we compared our accessibility score with the department exit ratio, by municipality. Department exit ratio is defined as the proportion of cancer patients who visited a care center outside from their department of residence and was computed using the \ac{pmsi} database. In Provence-Alpes-Cote-d'Azur, the exit ratio is higher in departments with low accessibility scores and few oncology specialized care centers, as in Alpes-de-Haute-Provence and Hautes-Alpes. While the Var department has some oncology centers, exit ratio remains high since larger care centers are in Marseille and Nice.

\subsection*{Provence-Alpes-Cote-d'Azur}

We now focus on the region Provence-Alpes-Cote-d'Azur. This region is the far southeastern on the mainland. The region's population was 5,048 million in 2018. Its prefecture and largest city is Marseille. The region contains six departments. Bouches-du-Rhone, Var and Alpes-Maritimes are located on the coastline and gather the largest cities like Marseille, Nice, or Toulon. Alpes-de-Haute-Provence, Vaucluse, and Hautes-Alpes are inland departments, with a majority of rural and mountainous areas. Results are shown on \cref{fig:accessibility-paca}. By comparing maps (A) and (B), we confirm that the accessibility is maximum in denser areas of the region. Average patients travel time are displayed on map (C) and we drew the major roads (primary, motorway and truck) in red. The road system is well developed on the coast, rallying the larger cities of the region. However, driving from the rural areas in the Alps to the major cities is hard, resulting in higher travel times. The accessibility is unevenly spread within the departments, especially in Alpes-Maritimes where the distribution is multi-modal (D). There, cities like Nice and Cannes have large hospitals thus good accessibility, while the northern areas of the department are mostly mountains. Accessibility is higher in municipalities with dense populations, for all the departments (E). Finally, the average travel time decreases when the accessibility score increases. This makes sense since the accessibility score was computed based on the driving distance between population locations and care centers. However, it confirms that patients living in poor accessibility zones effectively travel further to seek oncology care. In Bouches-du-Rhone, nearly all the municipalities have an average travel time lower than 30 minutes, while in Alpes-de-Haute-Provence, average travel times are rarely lower than 60 minutes (F).

\subsection*{Pays de la Loire}

The Pays de la Loire is a region of the French Grand Ouest which includes the departments of Loire-Atlantique, Maine-et-Loire, Mayenne, Sarthe and Vendée. The prefecture of the region is Nantes. The region's population was 3,806,461 inhabitants in 2019, making it the 8th/18 most populated region in France. The major population concentrations are organized around the seven major urban centers with more than 100,000 inhabitants: Nantes, Angers, Le Mans, La Roche-sur-Yon, Cholet, Saint-Nazaire and Laval.

\subsection*{Occitanie}

The Occitanie region is located in the South of France. It covers 72,724 km\textsuperscript{2} for a population of 5,933,185 (Insee) in 2019, for a population density of 81.6 inhabitants/km\textsuperscript{2} the 6th least dense region in metropolitan France.
The rural territory in Occitanie represents 90\% of the territory, mainly present in the mountain areas of the Massif Central and Pyrenees. The urban space is mainly found along the coast and in the Garonne basin. 39\% of the population lives in rural areas, i.e. 2.9 million inhabitants, and 9 of the 13 departments are considered rural. However, Occitanie is a largely urbanized territory with numerous urban centers in each department, the main metropolises being Toulouse and Montpellier. This region is the 5th most urbanized region of the metropolis and has more than fifty urban units of at least 10,000 inhabitants with several cities exceeding 70,000 inhabitants (Tarbes, Montauban, Albi). 4.4 million people live in the urban units, representing 76\% of the population. Occitanie is composed of 13 departments. Three departments are among the most urbanized in the province and therefore have a strong demographic weight: Hérault (89\% of the population residing in an urban unit), Pyrénées-Orientales (88\%) and Haute-Garonne (87\%). The Hérault department includes the city of Montpellier, but also Béziers, Sète and many small urban areas. The Haute Garonne includes the city of Toulouse, the fourth most populated commune in France (493,465 inhabitants) and with its rural areas are under strong pole influence.  The Lot, Lozère and Gers are the least urbanized in France, with less than 40\% of the population living in urban areas. Looking at the maps, we can see that accessibility is not uniform across the territory. The areas with the highest accessibility scores are concentrated in the major urban areas and their catchment areas, notably in the center of the region around the city of Toulouse and Montauban in the Garonne basin, as well as along the coastline in the east of the region around the cities of Nîmes, Montpellier, Béziers, Narbonne, and Perpignan. Also, if the most densely populated areas have a good level of accessibility, it can be seen that some medium-sized cities in the Occitanie region lack a good level of accessibility and even have low accessibility. This is particularly pronounced in the rural departments of the region (Lot, Gers and Lozère), as well as in Aude, Ariège and Hautes-Pyrénées. Indeed, many urban units have a low Q2 accessibility score such as Auch (25,527 inhabitants) in the Gers, Foix (12,310 inhabitants) and Pamiers (29,340 inhabitants) in the Ariege, Rodez (47,868 inhabitants) in the Aveyron with a Q2/Q3 score, Cahors (24,279 inhabitants) in the Lot. Many areas of the region have long travel times of around 90 minutes if not 120 minutes on average. This is particularly true along the border with Spain, which is characterized by its mountainous terrain.

\subsection*{Nouvelle-Aquitaine}

The Nouvelle-Aquitaine region is located in the south west of France and covers covers 84,036 km\textsuperscript{2}, making it the largest region in France, with an area larger than Austria. It includes twelve departments: Charente, Charente-Maritime, Corrèze, Creuse, Dordogne, Gironde, Landes, Lot-et-Garonne, Pyrénées-Atlantiques, Deux-Sèvres, Vienne and Haute-Vienne. Its largest city and regional capital, Bordeaux, hosts over 925,000 inhabitants and is the seventh largest in France. The growth of its population, particularly marked on the coast, makes it one of the most attractive areas in France.
Its economy is essentially based on agriculture and viticulture, shellfish farming and on a performing industrial sector with a powerful aeronautic and space industry. The largest municipalities in the region are Bordeaux, Limoges, Poitiers, La Rochelle, Pau and Mérignac.

\subsection*{Normandie}

The Normandie region is located in the north west of the country, next to the Channel Sea. Its population was 3,325,032 inhabitants in 2019 and the region covers 29,906 km\textsuperscript{2}. Normandie has 5 departments: Calvados, Eure, Manche, Orne and Seine-Maritime. The region's largest municipalities are Rouen, Caen and Le Havre.

\subsection*{Île-de-France}

The Île-de-France (IdF) region is located in the center north of France. This one covers 12,012 km\textsuperscript{2} for a population of 12,213,447 (Insee) in 2018. The IdF region is the most populated and dense of metropolitan France. Only 5\% of the population lives in a rural commune, for the 671 rural communes cover 59\% of the IdF territory. The majority of rural communes (85\%) are under the influence of Paris. Île-de-France is composed of 8 departments, 4 departments in the inner suburbs and 4 departments in the outer suburbs. It is a special region because it includes the French capital, Paris, the leading French city in terms of demography and population density with 2,175,601 inhabitants in 2021. The city of Paris is also home to many specialized health establishments. The rural communes are far from the influence of Paris and are mainly located in the departments of the outer suburbs, three quarters of which are in Seine-et-Marne. The most rural and least dense areas are therefore mainly located in the east of the region, particularly along the border to the east of the Seine-et-Marne department. Looking at the maps, we can see that Île-de-France has good accessibility over the vast majority of its territory. Indeed, 63.8\% of the population of IdF is located in an area with a maximum accessibility score, and almost no population is located in an area with a minimum accessibility score Q1 or even Q2. Also, although only 9\% of the territory's surface is identified as having a Q5 score and 15\% as having a Q1 score, the minimum accessibility zones are not very densely populated, which only affects a very small part of the region's population (Figure 7A and B). Indeed, we observe that the only areas with a Q1 score are located in the eastern part of the region in the Seine-et-Marne department where the population density is very low. Moreover, travel time is uniform throughout the region with a very good level of travel time limited to an average of 30 minutes. The Ile-de-France region does not suffer from accessibility difficulties at any level for cancer treatments, regardless of location in the territory.

\subsection*{Hauts-de-France}

The Hauts-de-France region is located in the north of France. It covers 31,948km² for a population of 6,005,000 (Insee) in 2019, or 9\% of the metropolitan population. The region has retained a strong industrial footprint. It is the second most urbanized region after Ile de France with 89\% of its population living in a large urban area. However, 83\% of the region's municipalities are considered rural (including autonomous rurality and rurality under the influence of a pole in a peri-urban area), with 29\% of the region's population living in a so-called rural municipality.
The Hauts-de-France is composed of 5 departments. In the department of Nord in the north of the region, particularly urbanized and densified, is the city of Lille which has 1,411,571 inhabitants in its metropolis. Amiens in the department of Somme is the second most populated urban area in the region. Looking at the maps, we can see that the accessibility zones are relatively evenly distributed over the territory, although the best accessibility in this department is mainly in the urban and peri-urban area of Lille (Figure 20A). Travel time averages 30 minutes over most of the region, with the exception of the northern end of the region in the Aisne department and the northeastern part of the same department, where travel time averages 60 to 90 minutes. The population density is also low in these areas, the Aisne being the least populated department in the Hauts-de-France region.
Only 4.4\% of the population of Hauts-de-France is located in an area with an accessibility quantile of Q1 and 16.6\% in Q2. It is possible to perceive that certain parts of the territory with a medium (100-200) to high (>200) population density have an accessibility qualified at Q2 and Q3 (Figure 20A-B), which implies a difficulty of accessibility of optimal care for certain segments of the population. In fact, despite a low population rate in Q1, only 32.5\% of the regional population is located in an area with the highest quantile of accessibility Q5. These observations allow us to consider that the improvement of accessibility to optimal care in this territory could be easily optimized because the initial care offer is already well distributed in the territory with accessibility zones Q4 and Q3, which together account for 46.4\% of the population.

\subsection*{Grand Est}

The Grand Est region is located in the east of France. It covers 57,433 km\textsuperscript{2} for a population of 5,556,219 (Insee) in 2019. 39\% of the population resides in a rural commune (i.e., a commune with low or very low density). 61\% of the population resides in urban areas, 22.8\% in peri-urban rural areas and 16.2\% in autonomous rural areas, moreover nearly 80\% of the regional surface is dedicated to agriculture and forestry.
The Grand Est is composed of 8 departments. The departments of Meuse and Haute-Marne central to the region are among the most rural departments in France with respectively 74\% and 67\% of their population living in rural areas (peri-urban and autonomous), while the departments of Haut-Rhin, Bas-Rhin, Meurthe-et-Moselle and Moselle have more than 60\% of their population living in urban areas (2018, Insee). The department of Marne in the west of the region is home to Reims, the most densely populated city in the region after Strasbourg. Looking at the maps we can see good accessibility in the eastern half of the region in the departments of Moselle, Meurthe et Moselle, Bas-Rhin, Haut-Rhin, particularly around the large agglomerations (Strasbourg, Nancy, Metz, Colmar). Indeed, 41\% of the population of the Grand Est is in an accessibility zone of Q5 (Figure 7B) and only 7.5\% in a Q1 zone. The lack of accessibility in the western part of the region is more pronounced due to the low or very low density areas that are more common in these departments. Also, the link between population density and accessibility is visible and reinforced by the consideration of average travel times. Travel times are almost uniformly distributed over the entire territory, with little or no travel time exceeding 30 minutes; travel times of 60 minutes on average are limited and those of 90 minutes are very limited. These times are most prevalent in the western half of the region in the very low density areas but mostly in the less demographically dense areas.  The poor accessibility for the city of Charles-Ville-Mézière (46,436 inhabitants in 2019) is more worrying in view of its demographic density.
However, it can be observed that the coverage of maximum accessibility for the majority of the population does not necessarily require a spatial accessibility spread over the surface of the region, since the Grand Est has only 13.5\% of the surface of its territory considered as Q5 accessibility, but covers the needs of maximum accessibility for 41\ of its population. Thus, the urban nature of the population of the Grand Est seems to be a determining factor in maximizing accessibility to care.

\subsection*{Centre-Val de Loire}

The Centre-Val-de-Loire region is located in the center west of France. It covers an area of 39 151 km\textsuperscript{2} with a population of 2 573 180 (Insee) in 2019.
The region is one of the most rural regions of France, with 90\% of its territory occupied by rural municipalities and 1 in 2 inhabitants living in a rural municipality (49\%). 27\% of the population (700,000 inhabitants) live in a rural commune under the influence of a major pole and nearly 22\% (of 570,000) outside the area of attraction of such a pole.
However, the CVdL includes two metropolitan areas, Orléans in the department of xx and Tour in Indre-et-Loire, which together account for one-third of the regional population. Paris also has an influence on the region, affecting 184,000 inhabitants under its influence, i.e., 7\% of the CVdL population. Thus, the majority of the population (90\%) lives in an attractive urban area. The Hauts-de-France is made up of 6 departments. The department of Indre-et-Loire includes and Loiret includes the two metropolitan areas of the region Tour with 137,665 inhabitants and Orleans with 288,229 inhabitants in 2019. Looking at the maps, we can see that the accessibility of the whole region is relatively lower than in other regions observed so far. Many areas have a low or very low accessibility score despite a medium population density (Figure 16A). Areas with low or very low population density can have a very low accessibility score, although low-density areas of the Cher have a score around the Q3 quantile. Only the city of Tour and its vicinity shows a maximum level of accessibility, as well as some surrounding parcel areas in the department of Loir-et-Cher around the city of Blois and in the department of Cher around Bourges. Even the city of Orleans has an accessibility score of Q4 despite the presence of level 1 clusters (Figure 16A). The CVdL has the particularity of being the only French region without a \ac{clcc} on its territory. The closest \ac{clcc} are those in adjacent regions, in Paris in the Île-de-France and Anger in Normandy. We can deduce that in order to access a specialized center, the inhabitants of this region have to leave the region.  We can see that the level 1 clusters in the region are located in Tour, Orléans and Chartes. The departments in the south of the region have lower level clusters, with the Cher having only a level 3 and a level 7 cluster. This is reflected in the travel times which are rather homogeneous and low in the northern and central departments with average travel times of 30 minutes, while the southern departments, Indre and Cher have much higher travel times throughout their territory, around 60 minutes and 90 minutes.

\subsection*{Bretagne}

The Bretagne region is located on the north west of the country. It is composed of 4 departments: Côtes-d'Armor, Finistère, Ille-et-Vilaine and Morbihan. Bathed by the Channel Sea to the north, the Celtic Sea to the west and the Atlantic Ocean to the south, it borders the regions of Normandy and Pays de la Loire. Its prefecture and largest city is Rennes, followed by Brest.
The exodus to other regions was significant but eventually reversed and, since the mid-1960s, net migration has become positive. The youngest continue to leave the region but active adults and retirees are numerous to settle. Rennes, Brest, and Vannes form attractive urban centers around which a highly urbanized circle is formed. Since the 20th century, the population has tended to concentrate on the coast, particularly on the southern part. Conversely, the inner areas tends to be depopulated while maintaining an economic fabric oriented towards agriculture and small industry.

\subsection*{Bourgogne-Franche-Comté}

The Bourgogne-Franche-Comté (BFC) region is located in the center-east of France. It covers 47,784 km\textsuperscript{2} for a population of 2,805,580 (Insee) in 2019 with 1,242,882 active people. In 2018 the BFC is considered the first rural region of France with more than half of its population (1.5 million people) residing in rural areas. The BFC is composed of 8 departments. The departments of Yvonne, Nièvre to the west, Saône-et-Loire and Jura to the south, have a particularly rural and agricultural landscape without dense urban areas, especially for Saône-et-Loire.  In the department of Côte-d'Or is located Dijon, the largest and most densely populated city in the region with 158,002 inhabitants, ahead of the city of Besançon with its 117,912 inhabitants, which is located to the east in the department of Doub. In total, the BFC region has 3,704 municipalities, 26 of which have more than 10,000 inhabitants. Looking at the maps, it can be seen that the departments of Côte-d'Or and Doubs have the best accessibility, especially around densely populated urban areas such as Dijon or Besançon (Figure 12A). Some areas of the region have a low accessibility quantile Q1 and Q2 which cover 37.3\% and 16.4\% respectively (Figure 7A) of the regional territory, i.e. more than half (53.7\%) of the area is recognized with a level of accessibility to cancer care. The areas with low or very low accessibility are located mainly in rural areas and with low or very low population density, except for the eastern border of the Doub, which has more densely populated areas, but with more mountainous terrain, with a quantile 1 accessibility. In each department, accessibility is best in the urban areas and their surroundings.
The travel time shows an unequal distribution of access to health care in the territory, since the majority of municipalities have an average travel time of 30 minutes, but large areas of the region show average travel times of 60 or 90 minutes, particularly in the departments of Nièvre and Yvonne, although in the less densely populated areas of these departments, or travel times exceeding 120 minutes in the east of the Jura at the Swiss border, which is, however, likely to be a more mountainous terrain

\subsection*{Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes}

The Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes (ARA) region is located in eastern France. It covers 69,711 km\textsuperscript{2} for a population of 7,994,459 (Insee) in 2018, representing 12.3\% of the metropolitan population, i.e. the most populated region in France. The ARA is the main mountain region of France with 2.2 million people residing in a municipality classified as a mountain area, with more than half in the regional part of the Massif Central which is distributed in a diagonal of low population density, while the population of the Alpine massif is concentrated in the urbanized and more densely populated parts at the bottom of valleys. In the ARA, 35\% of the population lives in a rural commune, the provincial metropolitan average being 33\%, and these communes cover 89\% of the region's surface area. The ARA is composed of 12 departments. The Rhône department in the northern center of the region includes the city of Lyon, the second largest city in France, which has 1,411,571 inhabitants in its metropolis. The eastern departments, Savoie, Haute-Savoie, Isère, Drôme, constitute the mountainous areas of the region. Of the twelve departments, five are considered 'essentially rural': Cantal (74\% of the inhabitants live in rural communes), Haute-Loire (70\%), Ardèche (60\%), Allier (58\%) and Ain (50\%). If we look at the maps, we can see that the areas with the lowest accessibility are mainly located in areas with low or very low density, particularly along the mountainous border in the east of the region in the departments of Haute-Savoie, Savoie, Isère and Drôme. It is possible to observe a good distribution of accessibility in the central, northern and north-western part of the region, particularly around the large agglomerations such as the city of Lyon, Clermont-Ferrand, Moulins, Grenoble and Aurillac. The three southern departments, Haute-Loire, Ardèche and Drôme, are less accessible than the other departments in the region. Above all, it can be observed that the mountainous terrain tends to have a strong impact on accessibility to care, since travel times in these areas, particularly for the departments of Drôme and Savoie, reach an average of 120 minutes if not 150 minutes. In the mountainous departments of the east, the valleys that contain the urban centers with the highest population density, such as Chambéry, Grenoble and Annecy, are the most favorable accessibility centers in these departments. Despite its mountainous nature, 51.1\% of the Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes region is located in an accessibility zone Q5 compared to 8\% in an accessibility zone Q1.

\section{Discussion}

Specific attention should be given to municipalities with very poor access to oncology care centers. While we saw that most of the population lives in high accessibility areas, around 6\% of the population lives in the bottom 20\% accessibility quantile. Among these municipalities, some are very rural and mountainous like those in the Alpes-de-Haute-Provence in Provence-Alpes-Cote-d'Azur region. Such areas cannot be expected to have a very good healthcare coverage. By contrast, the case of suburban areas with relatively dense population and poor accessibility should be addressed more easily. Our optimization algorithm can help driving public health policies, as it effectively identifies areas where accessibility could grow, by allocating additional oncology activity to a restricted number of care centers. The proposed growth factors are indicative and do not have to be effective within a year, as it represents a considerable effort for care centers to increase their activity.
Our oncology accessibility score is deliberately non-specific to cancer type. This score is meant to outline how easy it would be for a population location to reach a first entry point for oncology care. Here, we are only focusing on surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy treatments. The same technique could be used on a specific cancer type, the method will remain the same, only the supply variable used in the accessibility score will change. We should mention that \ac{sa} is better suited for pathologies that are relatively well handled across the whole country. Accessibility for rare diseases like pediatric cancer or complex cancers that re-quire a specific expertise is less informative because only a handful of care centers are indicated.
Similarly, we could compute an accessibility score that is focused on specific kinds of stays: our web application lets the user pick between surgery, chemotherapy, or radiotherapy as supply variable.
