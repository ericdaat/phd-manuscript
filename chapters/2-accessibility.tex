\chapter{Accessibility to oncology care}

\section{Context}

\subsection{Motivation}

While a lot of the ongoing research is focusing on finding new cancer treatments, accessibility to oncology care receives less attention. Yet, several studies have showed that access to health services plays a key role in cancer survival. For instance, geographic residency status and social environment seem to explain treatment and prognosis disparities for patients with non-small cell lung cancer \cite{johnson_treatment_2014}. In France, increases in travel times to health services were associated with lower survival rates for patients with a colorectal cancer \cite{dejardin_influence_2014}. In New Zealand, living in deprived areas, far from a cancer center or from primary care was associated with lower survival chances for patients with colorectal, lung and prostate cancers \cite{haynes_cancer_2008}.

\subsection{Accessibility definition}

Accessibility refers to the relative ease by which services can be reached from a given location \cite{wang_measurement_2012}. Accessibility can be defined by spatial factors, determined by where you are; and non-spatial factors, determined by who you are \cite{khan_integrated_1992}. \ac{sa} methods assess the availability of supply locations from demand locations, connected by a travel impedance metric. Supply locations are characterized by their capacity or quantity of available resource. Similarly, demand locations are characterized by their population. Such methods have been successfully used to measure access to healthcare, such as primary care \cite{guagliardo_spatial_2004} or oncology care \cite{wang_measurement_2012,zahnd_spatial_2021,alahmadi_spatial_2013} in several countries including France \cite{launay_methodology_2019,gusmano_disparities_2014,gao_assessment_2016}. In what follows, we restrict accessibility to \acf{sa} and use both terms interchangeably.

\subsection{\acf{sa} methods}

There are several ways to compute accessibility to healthcare as reviewed in \cite{guagliardo_spatial_2004}. We detail these methods in the following sections.

\subsubsection{Provider-to-population ratios}

% Definition
The easiest and most straightforward \ac{sa} method is to compute provider-to-population ratios, also referred as supply ratios. The ratio involves some indicator of health service capacity (supply) as numerator; while the denominator is the population size within the area (demand). For instance, when measuring accessibility to primary care, one might use the number of physicians in the area as supply, and area population as demand. The resulting ratio might be interpreted as the number of physicians per 100,000 inhabitants \cite{schonfeld_numbers_1972}.

% Pros
Supply ratios are highly interpretable, and relevant for comparisons of supply in large areas. Policy analysts have used these metrics to set minimal standards of supply and identify under-served areas where supply should be increased  \cite{schonfeld_numbers_1972,council_on_graduate_medical_education_physician_1998,connor_competition_1995}

% Cons
However, supply ratios have limitations that often prevent their usage in more detailed analysis. First, they do not account for patient border crossing, which commonly occurs for small areas \cite{connor_measuring_1994,basu_border-crossing_1996,basu_medicare_1995,holahan_border_1993}. Second, supply ratios are constant within the bordered area, which will lead to imprecision and false generalization in large areas. Finally, they do not consider travel impedance, which plays a major role in \ac{sa}. Consequently the results and interpretations can vary greatly depending on the size, number and configuration of the areal units studied. This problem is well-known to geographers and spatial analysts as the modifiable areal unit problem (MAUP) \cite{openshaw_modifiable_1983}.

\subsubsection{Travel impedance to providers}

% Definition
As stated earlier, travel impedance is a key aspect of \ac{sa} evaluation. It is typically measured from a patient's residence or from the centroid of a population location when the precise location is not available. The impedance can be expressed in different ways: euclidean (straight) distance, travel distance or estimated travel time.

% Pros
Travel impedance is suited for rural areas, where providers are limited and patients often travel to the nearest choice available.

% Cons
However, travel impedance is less relevant for urban areas. Indeed, there are numerous reasonable options available at a similar distance and patients won't travel to the closest one anymore. Moreover, travel impedance is a poor indicator of availability and should be combined with supply to properly evaluate \ac{sa} \cite{fryer_multi-method_1999}.

\subsubsection{Gravity models}

% Definition
Gravity models are more sophisticated ways to evaluate \ac{sa}, based on a modified version of Newton's Law of Gravitation. They were initially developed to predict retail travel \cite{reilly_law_1931} and help with land use planning \cite{hansen_how_1959}. Gravity models combine both accessibility and availability, and work well in urban and rural settings. Gravity models represent the influence of all service points located within a reasonable distance from a population location. The influence is discounted by the increasing distance or travel impedance. The simplest formula for gravity-based accessibility is:

\begin{equation}
    A_i = \sum_j \frac{S_j}{d_{ij}^{\beta}}
\end{equation}

In this equation, $A_i$ is the accessibility score at population location $i$. $S_j$ is the capacity of the service point $j$, and $d_{ij}$ the travel impedance (e.g. distance or travel time) between population location $i$ and service point $j$. We set $\beta$ as a gravity decay coefficient, sometimes referred to as the travel friction coefficient. Intuitively, $\beta$ represents the change in difficulty of travel as the impedance value increases. The accessibility score increases with higher provider capacity, and decreases with higher travel impedance. Gravity models are an elegant way to compute accessibility, which accounts for border crossing, local variations, and travel impedance.

% Cons
The main drawbacks of this approach is the lack of intuitiveness, and healthcare policy makers prefer to think of \ac{sa} in terms of provider-to-population ratios or simple distance. Second, it only models supply and does not account for demand. Providers should not be equally accessible if they serve population locations with drastically different population sizes.
A proposed solution is to add a population demand factor $V_j$, to the denominator \cite{joseph_measuring_1982}:

\begin{equation}
    V_j = \sum_k \frac{P_k}{d_{kj}^{\beta}}
\end{equation}

Here, $P_k$ is the population size at population location $k$, and $d_{kj}$ is the distance between the population location $k$ and provider location $j$. Intuitively, the demand on provider location $j$ is obtained by summing the gravity discounted influence of all population points within a reasonable distance. The improved gravity model is:

\begin{equation}
    A_i = \sum_j \frac{S_j}{d_{ij}^{\beta} V_j}
\end{equation}

However, another problem is that the distance decay coefficient, $\beta$, is usually unknown and hard to estimate. Its form and magnitude can vary greatly with the service type and population under study \cite{talen_assessing_1998}.

\subsubsection{\acf{2sfca}}

Recently, a new type of method has been developed and is now used in most \ac{sa} papers. This algorithm is called \ac{2sfca} \cite{luo_using_2004}. It is a two-step method that first computes a provider-to-population ratio for each provider location. In the second step, for each population location, an accessibility score is obtained by summing the provider-to-population ratios. For the algorithm to work, a catchment threshold (distance or travel time) must be set. Above this threshold, a provider location is considered unreachable from the population location, and vice versa.

\subsubsection{\acf{e2sfca}}

The \ac{2sfca} method does not account for distance decay: a provider is either reachable or not. The \ac{e2sfca} \cite{luo_enhanced_2009} addresses this limitation by applying weights to differentiate travel zones in both steps.

Consider $P_i$ the population at location $i$, with $1 \leq i \leq n$ where $n$ is the number of population locations. Similarly, consider $S_u$ the capacity of care center $u$, with $1 \leq u \leq m$ where $m$ is the number of care centers. Finally, let $d_{iu}$ be the matrix of size $n \times m$ containing the distances between location $i$ and providers $u$. We consider $r$ sub-catchment zones each associated with a weight $W_s$, and a distance $D_s$, with $1 \leq s \leq r$, such that $D_1 < D_2 < ... < D_r$ and $W_1 > W_2 > ... > W_r$. The resulting r travel intervals are $I_1=[0, D_1], I_2=[D_1, D_2 ], ... ,I_r=[D_{r-1}-,D_r]$. The accessibility $A_i$ of a population location $i$ is computed in two steps:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Step 1: for every care center $u$, compute its weighted capacity-to-population ratio $R_u$.
    \item Step 2: for every population location, compute $A_i$ as the sum all the weighted $R_u$ of the reachable providers.
\end{itemize}

\begin{align}
    R_u & =  \frac{S_u}{\sum_{s=1}^{r} W_s \sum_{i, d_{iu} \in I_s} P_i} \\
    A_i & = \sum_{s=1}^{r} W_s \sum_{u, d_{iu} \in I_s} R_u
\end{align}

\subsubsection{Multi modal \acl{2sfca}}

The \ac{e2sfca} methodology can be enhanced by incorporating both public and private transport modes \cite{langford_multi-modal_2016}. The proposed model yields separate accessibility scores for each modal group at each demand point to better reflect the differential accessibility levels experienced by each cohort.

Suppose that each method of travel (car, bus, walking, etc.) necessitates a dedicated transport network and let each such network be referred to as $N_1, N_2, ..., N_M$. In order to accommodate independent networks for each travel mode into the \ac{e2sfca} model, the computation of Step 1 becomes:

\begin{equation}
    R_u =  \frac{S_u}{\sum_{m=1}^{M} \sum_{s=1}^{r} W_{s,m} \sum_{i, d_{iu,m} \in I_s} P_{i,m}} \\
\end{equation}

Similarly for Step 2:

\begin{equation}
    A_i = \sum_{m=1}^{M} \sum_{s=1}^{r} W_{s, m} \sum_{u, d_{iu} \in I_s} R_u
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Huff model and \acl{2sfca}}

The \ac{e2sfca} does not consider competition among multiple healthcare sites available for a population location \cite{wan_three-step_2012}, and therefore it may lead to overestimation for some sites \cite{luo_integrating_2014}. The Huff Model is a widely accepted method for quantifying the probability of people's selection on a service site out of multiple available ones \cite{huff_probabilistic_1963}. It specifically aims to estimate/model people's choice on a service site with two factors: (1) distance to the service site; and (2) the attraction of the service site.

\begin{equation}
    Prob_{i,j} = \frac{C_i d_{ij}^{-\beta}}{\sum_{s \in D_0} C_s d_{is}^{-\beta}}
\end{equation}

Where:

\begin{itemize}
    \item $Prob_{i,j}$ is the probability of population location $i$ visiting service site $j$
    \item $d_{ij}$ is the travel time between $i$ and $j$
    \item $\beta$ is the distance impedance coefficient
    \item $C_j$ is the capacity \/ attractiveness of service site $j$
    \item $s$ is any service site within the catchment $D_0$ of $i$
\end{itemize}

Incorporating into the \ac{e2sfca} steps gives:

\begin{align}
    R_u & =  \frac{S_u}{\sum_{s=1}^{r} W_s \sum_{i, d_{iu} \in I_s} Prob_{i,u} P_i} \\
    A_i & = \sum_{s=1}^{r} W_s \sum_{u, d_{iu} \in I_s} Prob_{i,u} R_u
\end{align}

\section{Methods}

We computed the \ac{sa} score to these care centers for every municipality in metropolitan France, using the \ac{e2sfca} algorithm and oncology activity as supply variable. We compared the accessibility distributions with \ac{e2sfca} vs. regular \ac{2sfca}. The accessibility was lower with \ac{e2sfca} because of the weight decay. We also studied the influence of the supply variable in the accessibility score. Accessibility is much higher if we use the number of \ac{mco} stays as supply, instead of the oncology activity. This makes sense since oncology care centers are less common and the overall \ac{mco} activity is higher than the oncology activity.

\section{Results}

The oncology accessibility is unevenly distributed across the country, as displayed on \cref{fig:accessibility-france}. For better readability, we cut the accessibility scores into 5 quantiles. Q5 colored in dark green contains the top 20\% accessibility municipalities, and Q1 in light yellow contains the bottom 20\% ones. The lowest accessibility zones are mostly located in the center of the country and in mountainous regions like the Alps or the Pyrenees. Plot (B) shows that most of the population (51.6\%) lives in top 20\% accessibility municipalities, while 6.3\% lives in the bottom 20\% quantile. On map (A), care centers are displayed as squares, colored by cluster index, and sized by oncology activity. We see that accessibility is highest near the most specialized care centers. Indeed, the proportion of care centers from specialized clusters decreases in lower accessibility quantiles (C). We then ranked the departments by median accessibility and showed the top-10 and bottom 10 on plot (D). Among the top-5 departments, 4 are in Ile-de-France. Departments from the bottom-10 are rural or mountainous areas like Lozère and Alpes-de-Haute-Provence.  We notice disparities within departments as well, as outlined by the large interquartile range in Hérault or Alpes-Maritimes. On the contrary, this spread is very narrow in Ile-de-France departments.

\end{figure}

Accessibility score should be put into perspective with population density. Overall, the denser municipalities have a median accessibility around 0.02. Municipalities with low population densities have more extreme values.  \cref{fig:accessibility-vs-density} compares accessibility and population density for three different regions: Provence-Alpes-Cote-d'Azur (A), Ile-de-France (B), and Bourgogne-Franche-Comté (C). Municipalities are displayed as squares, colored by accessibility quantile, and sized by population density. These regions show very different profiles. In Provence-Alpes-Cote-d'Azur (A), accessibility is essentially low in non-dense municipalities near the Alps. However, in Bourgogne-Franche-Comté (C), we see dense municipalities with poor accessibility scores, representing a large proportion of the region. We also drew similar maps (D, E and F) where municipalities are colored based on the average travel duration for patients with cancer in 2018. We see that the average travel time is higher in municipalities with poor accessibility scores.

Municipalities are drawn as squares, sized by population density and colored by either accessibility quantile (A, B, C) or patient average travel time (D, E, F).
    }
    \label{fig:accessibility-vs-density}
\end{figure}

Finally, we compared our accessibility score with the department exit ratio, by municipality. Department exit ratio is defined as the proportion of cancer patients who visited a care center outside from their department of residence and was computed using the \ac{pmsi} database. In Provence-Alpes-Cote-d'Azur, the exit ratio is higher in departments with low accessibility scores and few oncology specialized care centers, as in Alpes-de-Haute-Provence and Hautes-Alpes. While the Var department has some oncology centers, exit ratio remains high since larger care centers are in Marseille and Nice.

\subsection*{Provence-Alpes-Cote-d'Azur}

We now focus on the region Provence-Alpes-Cote-d'Azur. This region is the far southeastern on the mainland. The region's population was 5,048 million in 2018. Its prefecture and largest city is Marseille. The region contains six departments. Bouches-du-Rhone, Var and Alpes-Maritimes are located on the coastline and gather the largest cities like Marseille, Nice, or Toulon. Alpes-de-Haute-Provence, Vaucluse, and Hautes-Alpes are inland departments, with a majority of rural and mountainous areas. Results are shown on \cref{fig:accessibility-paca}. By comparing maps (A) and (B), we confirm that the accessibility is maximum in denser areas of the region. Average patients travel time are displayed on map (C) and we drew the major roads (primary, motorway and truck) in red. The road system is well developed on the coast, rallying the larger cities of the region. However, driving from the rural areas in the Alps to the major cities is hard, resulting in higher travel times. The accessibility is unevenly spread within the departments, especially in Alpes-Maritimes where the distribution is multi-modal (D). There, cities like Nice and Cannes have large hospitals thus good accessibility, while the northern areas of the department are mostly mountains. Accessibility is higher in municipalities with dense populations, for all the departments (E). Finally, the average travel time decreases when the accessibility score increases. This makes sense since the accessibility score was computed based on the driving distance between population locations and care centers. However, it confirms that patients living in poor accessibility zones effectively travel further to seek oncology care. In Bouches-du-Rhone, nearly all the municipalities have an average travel time lower than 30 minutes, while in Alpes-de-Haute-Provence, average travel times are rarely lower than 60 minutes (F).

\subsection*{Pays de la Loire}

The Pays de la Loire is a region of the French Grand Ouest which includes the departments of Loire-Atlantique, Maine-et-Loire, Mayenne, Sarthe and Vendée. The prefecture of the region is Nantes. The region's population was 3,806,461 inhabitants in 2019, making it the 8th/18 most populated region in France. The major population concentrations are organized around the seven major urban centers with more than 100,000 inhabitants: Nantes, Angers, Le Mans, La Roche-sur-Yon, Cholet, Saint-Nazaire and Laval.

\subsection*{Occitanie}

Occitanie is an administrative region in the southwest and southeast of France. It comprises 13 departments: Ariège, Aude, Aveyron, Gard, Haute-Garonne, Gers, Hérault, Lot, Lozère, Hautes-Pyrénées, Pyrénées-Orientales, Tarn, Tarn-et-Garonne. Its prefecture is Toulouse. The region covers 72,724 km\textsuperscript{2}, making it the the second largest in metropolitan France behind Nouvelle-Aquitaine. Its population was 5,933,185 in 2019, making it the fifth most populous region in France. Its population density is lower than the average for metropolitan France, with 80 inhabitants/km\textsuperscript{2}, the sixth lowest density among French regions (and the fourth lowest among metropolitan regions). However, its population is very unevenly distributed, with two major cities Toulouse and Montpellier, a fairly densely populated Mediterranean coastline and rural areas belonging to the ``diagonale du vide''.

\subsection*{Nouvelle-Aquitaine}

The Nouvelle-Aquitaine region is located in the south west of France and covers covers 84,036 km\textsuperscript{2}, making it the largest region in France, with an area larger than Austria. It includes twelve departments: Charente, Charente-Maritime, Corrèze, Creuse, Dordogne, Gironde, Landes, Lot-et-Garonne, Pyrénées-Atlantiques, Deux-Sèvres, Vienne and Haute-Vienne. Its largest city and regional capital, Bordeaux, hosts over 925,000 inhabitants and is the seventh largest in France. The growth of its population, particularly marked on the coast, makes it one of the most attractive areas in France.
Its economy is essentially based on agriculture and viticulture, shellfish farming and on a performing industrial sector with a powerful aeronautic and space industry. The largest municipalities in the region are Bordeaux, Limoges, Poitiers, La Rochelle, Pau and Mérignac.

\subsection*{Île-de-France}

Île-de-France is a very densely populated region, accounting for 18.8\% of the population of metropolitan France alone in only 2.2\% of its area, making it the most populous (12.40 million inhabitants in 2022) and most densely populated (1,017 inhabitants/km\textsuperscript{2}) region in the country. Île-de-France is one of the smallest French regions, but by far the largest in terms of population and gross domestic product, which in 2014 accounted for 30.94\% of the GDP of France. The region is highly centralized in the Paris conurbation, which covers 23.7\% of the region's surface area, but where 88.6\% of its population lives. The Paris catchment area covers the entire surface area of the Ile-de-France region and parts of neighboring regions. With an area of 12,012 km\textsuperscript{2}. Concentrating the economic, administrative and political powers of a highly centralized country, it is at the center of a communication network that branches out in a star shape around Paris. The region contains 8 departments: Paris, Seine-et-Marne, Yvelines, Essonne, Hauts-de-Seine, Seine-Saint-Denis, Val-de-Marne and Val-d'Oise. The largest municipalities in the region are Paris, Nanterre, Boulogne-Billancourt and Montreuil.

The Hauts-de-France is a region located in the North of France. The region covers 31,806 km\textsuperscript{2} and has five departments: Aisne, Nord, Oise, Pas-de-Calais and Somme. Its capital is Lille, the main city of the region. Amiens is the second largest city in the region. The region is located north of Île-de-France, borders Belgium in the northeast and is bordered by the Channel Sea and the North Sea in the west and north. Located in the heart of Europe, with 6,004,947 inhabitants in 2019, and a population density of 189 inhabitants/km\textsuperscript{2}, it is the 3\textsuperscript{rd} most populated region in France and the 2\textsuperscript{nd} most densely populated in metropolitan France after Île-de-France.

\subsection*{Grand Est}

The Grand Est region is located in the north east of the country. It had a population of 5,550,3892 inhabitants in 2020 and covers 57,441 km\textsuperscript{2}. The region has 10 departments: Ardennes, Aube, Marne, Haute-Marne, Meurthe-et-Moselle, Meuse, Moselle, Bas-Rhin, Haut-Rhin and Vosges.
The region mixes territories of Rhine Europe (Alsace, Meurthe-et-Moselle, Moselle and the eastern Vosges) in the east and territories of the Paris basin (Ardennes and Marne) in the west, separated by the ``Diagonale du vide'' (which includes mostly territories of the Haute-Marne, Aube and Meuse). The region's largest city is Strasbourg, which is also the capital of the region. The Euro-metropolis of Strasbourg, which hosts several international institutions, is the largest inter-municipality in the region with 500,000 inhabitants. The French part of its catchment area accounts for more than 15\% of the population of the Grand Est. It is followed by the urban community of Greater Reims, Mulhouse Alsace Agglomeration , the Metropolis of Greater Nancy and the Euro-metropolis of Metz, all of which have more than 200,000 inhabitants. All five of these cities structure the region because of their large catchment areas.

\subsection*{Centre-Val de Loire}

Centre-Val de Loire is a region in western central France. Part of the region is located in the natural region of the Loire Valley. It is the seventh largest region in terms of area and covers 39,151 km\textsuperscript{2} and had a population of 2,573,180 inhabitants in 2019. Its population density is 66 hab/km\textsuperscript{2}, half that of metropolitan France, making it a sparsely populated region. The population density is higher on the Loire axis where half of the population lives. The region is composed of six departments: Cher, Eure-et-Loir, Indre, Indre-et-Loire, Loir-et-Cher and Loiret. There are only two municipalities with more than 100,000 inhabitants: Tours, ranked 26\textsuperscript{th} among the most populous communes in France with 135,787 inhabitants in 2017, and the regional prefecture Orleans, ranked 34\textsuperscript{th} with 114,644 inhabitants. The other departmental prefectures, Bourges, Blois, Châteauroux and Chartres, have populations between 38,000 and 67,000.

\subsection*{Bretagne}

The Bretagne region is located on the north west of the country. It is composed of 4 departments: Côtes-d'Armor, Finistère, Ille-et-Vilaine and Morbihan. Bathed by the Channel Sea to the north, the Celtic Sea to the west and the Atlantic Ocean to the south, it borders the regions of Normandy and Pays de la Loire. Its prefecture and largest city is Rennes, followed by Brest.
The exodus to other regions was significant but eventually reversed and, since the mid-1960s, net migration has become positive. The youngest continue to leave the region but active adults and retirees are numerous to settle. Rennes, Brest, and Vannes form attractive urban centers around which a highly urbanized circle is formed. Since the 20th century, the population has tended to concentrate on the coast, particularly on the southern part. Conversely, the inner areas tends to be depopulated while maintaining an economic fabric oriented towards agriculture and small industry.

\subsection*{Bourgogne-Franche-Comté}

Bourgogne-Franche-Comté is a region located in the Center-East of France. With an area of 47,784 km\textsuperscript{2}, it is the fifth largest of the thirteen regions of metropolitan France and includes eight departments: Côte-d'Or, Doubs, Haute-Saône, Jura, Nièvre, Saône-et-Loire, Territoire de Belfort and Yonne. Its population was 2,805,580 in 2019, making it the third least populated region and the second least densely populated (58.7 hab./km\textsuperscript{2}). The surface area of the Bourgogne-Franche-Comté region represents 9\% of the national territory, making it the 5th largest region in France, but the population density is half the average: the region had 2.8 million inhabitants in 2019, or 4.4\% of the national population.
Its capital and largest city is Dijon, followed by Besançon, Montbéliard and Chalon-Sur-Saone. The most populated department is Saône-et-Loire.
The most densely populated departments are Territoire de Belfort and Doubs, with population densities close to the metropolitan average. The other departments are much less dense.

\subsection*{Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes}

Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes is a region located in the south-eastern quarter of France. It has an area of 69,711 km\textsuperscript{2} and a population of 8,042,936 inhabitants in 2019. The regions has 12 departments: Ain, Allier, Ardèche, Cantal, Drome, Isère, Loire, Haute-Loire, Puy-de-Dome, Rhone, Lyon, Savoie and Haute-Savoie. Its capital and largest city is Lyon. The other largest cities in the region are Grenoble, Saint-Étienne and Clermont-Ferrand. The large agglomerations of Lyon, Clermont-Ferrand, Grenoble and Valence, which have been growing in population since 1975, as well as that of Saint-Étienne, stimulate suburban living areas thanks to their economic attraction. While the urban area of Clermont-Ferrand remains isolated in the west, all the others form a continuum polarized by Lyon. In the east, the rural areas of the Alps enjoy a very favorable economic situation thanks to the beneficial contribution of winter tourism. At the opposite end of the spectrum, two types of distressed rural areas face each other. The first, located mostly in the former Auvergne region, corresponds to mid-mountain territories, inhabited by an elderly and predominantly agricultural population. Public and private services are insufficient. In the Cantal, nearly 17\% of people over 75 years of age live below the poverty line, compared to only 9.3\% in Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes. The second is found in the south of the departments of Ardèche and Drôme and more locally in the Bocage bourbonnais or in the Livradois. These are rural living areas that are socially very fragile. These regions are heavily affected by unemployment, with 5\% of their active population unemployed for more than a year, compared to less than 4\% for the region as a whole.

\section{Discussion}

Specific attention should be given to municipalities with very poor access to oncology care centers. While we saw that most of the population lives in high accessibility areas, around 6\% of the population lives in the bottom 20\% accessibility quantile. Among these municipalities, some are very rural and mountainous like those in the Alpes-de-Haute-Provence in Provence-Alpes-Cote-d'Azur region. Such areas cannot be expected to have a very good healthcare coverage. By contrast, the case of suburban areas with relatively dense population and poor accessibility should be addressed more easily. Our optimization algorithm can help driving public health policies, as it effectively identifies areas where accessibility could grow, by allocating additional oncology activity to a restricted number of care centers. The proposed growth factors are indicative and do not have to be effective within a year, as it represents a considerable effort for care centers to increase their activity.
Our oncology accessibility score is deliberately non-specific to cancer type. This score is meant to outline how easy it would be for a population location to reach a first entry point for oncology care. Here, we are only focusing on surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy treatments. The same technique could be used on a specific cancer type, the method will remain the same, only the supply variable used in the accessibility score will change. We should mention that \ac{sa} is better suited for pathologies that are relatively well handled across the whole country. Accessibility for rare diseases like pediatric cancer or complex cancers that re-quire a specific expertise is less informative because only a handful of care centers are indicated.
Similarly, we could compute an accessibility score that is focused on specific kinds of stays: our web application lets the user pick between surgery, chemotherapy, or radiotherapy as supply variable.
