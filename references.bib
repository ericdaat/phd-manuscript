	abstract = {Two-step floating catchment area (2SFCA) techniques are popular for measuring potential geographical accessibility to health care services. This paper proposes methodological enhancements to increase the sophistication of the 2SFCA methodology by incorporating both public and private transport modes using dedicated network datasets. The proposed model yields separate accessibility scores for each modal group at each demand point to better reflect the differential accessibility levels experienced by each cohort. An empirical study of primary health care facilities in South Wales, UK, is used to illustrate the approach. Outcomes suggest the bus-riding cohort of each census tract experience much lower accessibility levels than those estimated by an undifferentiated (car-only) model. Car drivers' accessibility may also be misrepresented in an undifferentiated model because they potentially profit from the lower demand placed upon service provision points by bus riders. The ability to specify independent catchment sizes for each cohort in the multi-modal model allows aspects of preparedness to travel to be investigated.},

First, a two-step floating catchment area method implemented in Geographic Information Systems is used to measure spatial accessibility based on travel time.

Finally, spatial and nonspatial factors are integrated to identify areas with poor access to primary healthcare.

The traditional designation methods are primarily regional availability measures, which use administrative boundaries such as counties as the basic spatial units for calculating physician to population ratios and designate shortage based on those ratios. Such approaches have been criticized for their inability to account for either the spatial variations of population demand and physician supply within those boundaries or for population-physician interactions across them. The floating catchment method addresses the internal spatial distribution problem by deriving population data from a smaller unit, the census tract. The potential cross border patient–physician interaction is taken into consideration by using circles of reasonable radius around each census tract centroid as the basic spatial units, which can encompass areas on either side of an administrative border. By varying the radius of the catchment circle, this paper demonstrates that the physician to population ratio is scale dependent and that the greatest variability of the ratios and shortages occur at the most local scales ({\textless} 20 miles), which argues for using finer spatial resolution data in shortage designation practice.},

Despite Canada’s universal access to primary healthcare status, spatial accessibility to healthcare facilities is still an issue of concern due to the non-uniform distribution of primary healthcare facilities and population over space—leading to spatial inequity in the healthcare sector. Spatial inequity is further magnified when health-related accessibility studies are analyzed on the assumption of universal car access. To overcome car-centric studies of healthcare access, this study compares different travel modes—driving, public transit, and walking—to simulate the multi-modal access to primary healthcare services in the City of Calgary, Canada. Improving on floating catchment area methods, spatial accessibility was calculated based on the Spatial Access Ratio method, which takes into consideration the provider-to-population status of the region. The analysis revealed that, in the City of Calgary, spatial accessibility to the primary healthcare services is the highest for the people with an access to a car, and is significantly lower with multimodal (bus transit and train) means despite being a large urban centre. The social inequity issue raised from this analysis can be resolved by improving the city’s pedestrian infrastructure, public transportation, and construction of new clinics in regions of low accessibility.},

	abstract = {Background
Shenzhen has rapidly grown into a megacity in the recent decades. It is a challenging task for the Shenzhen government to provide sufficient healthcare services. The spatial configuration of healthcare services can influence the convenience for the consumers to obtain healthcare services. Spatial accessibility has been widely adopted as a scientific measurement for evaluating the rationality of the spatial configuration of healthcare services.

Methods
The multi-modal two-step floating catchment area (2SFCA) method is an important advance in the field of healthcare accessibility modelling, which enables the simultaneous assessment of spatial accessibility via multiple transport modes. This study further develops the multi-modal 2SFCA method by introducing online map APIs to improve the estimation of travel time by public transit or by car respectively.

Results
As the results show, the distribution of healthcare accessibility by multi-modal 2SFCA shows significant spatial disparity. Moreover, by dividing the multi-modal accessibility into car-mode and transit-mode accessibility, this study discovers that the transit-mode subgroup is disadvantaged in the competition for healthcare services with the car-mode subgroup. The disparity in transit-mode accessibility is the main reason of the uneven pattern of healthcare accessibility in Shenzhen.

Conclusions
The findings suggest improving the public transit conditions for accessing healthcare services to reduce the disparity of healthcare accessibility. More healthcare services should be allocated in the eastern and western Shenzhen, especially sub-districts in Dapeng District and western Bao’an District. As these findings cannot be drawn by the traditional single-modal 2SFCA method, the advantage of the multi-modal 2SFCA method is significant to both healthcare studies and healthcare system planning.},

The results show significant spatial differences in accessibility between the original and commuter-based version of the 2SFCA (CB2SFCA).

A dynamic buffering process in GIS is developed to measure the jobs-housing ratio within floating catchment areas of a 5-7 mile (8.05-11.27 km) radius as opposed to pre-defined and arbitrary jurisdictional boundaries. This study found a non-linear relationship between the jobs−housing ratio and VMT and trip length in the Portland, Oregon, metropolitan area. Only when the jobs−housing ratio is less than 1.2 or larger than 2.8 do VMT vary noticeably as the jobs−housing ratio changes. Marginal changes in VMT are small when the jobs−housing ratio is between 1.2 and 2.8. Since most areas in the study region have a job−household ratio between 1.2 and 2.8, any changes in the jobs−housing ratio will have little impact on VMT. Consequently, hardly any land use policy changes could affect the jobs−housing ratio enough to produce a significant change in VMT per capita, and jobs−housing policy will have limited impact on VMT at the regional level.},

Building on previous research, this paper proposes an enhanced variable two-step floating catchment area (EV2SFCA) method that determines facility catchment sizes by dynamically summing the population around the facility until the facility-to-population ratio (FPR) is less than the FPR threshold (FPRT). To minimize the errors from the supply and demand catchments being mismatched, this paper proposes that the facility and population catchment areas must both contain the other location in calculating accessibility. A case study evaluating spatial accessibility to residential care facilities in Nanjing demonstrates that the proposed method is effective in accurately determining catchment sizes and identifying details in the variation of spatial accessibility. The proposed method can be easily applied to assess other public healthcare facilities, and can provide guidance to government departments on issues of spatial planning and identification of shortage and excess areas.},

Within this method we focused on the distance decay function and its parameter. So far only distance decay functions with constant parameters have been applied. Therefore, we developed a variable distance decay function to be used within the FCA method. We were able to replace the impedance coefficient β by readily available distribution parameter (i.e. median and standard deviation (SD)) within a logistic based distance decay function. Hence, the function is shaped individually for every single population location by the median and SD of all population-to-provider distances within a global catchment size. Theoretical application of the variable distance decay function showed conceptually sound results. Furthermore, the existence of effective variable catchment sizes defined by the asymptotic approach to zero of the distance decay function was revealed, satisfying the need for variable catchment sizes. The application of the iFCA method within an urban case study in Berlin (Germany) confirmed the theoretical fit of the suggested method. In summary, we introduced for the first time, a variable distance decay function within an integrated FCA method. This function accounts for individual travel behaviors determined by the distribution of providers. Additionally, the function inherits effective variable catchment sizes and therefore obviates the need for determining variable catchment sizes separately.},

	abstract = {This study integrated accessibility and location-allocation models in geographic information systems as a proposed strategy to improve the spatial planning of public health services. To estimate the spatial accessibility, we modified the two-step floating catchment area (2SFCA) model with a different impedance function, a Gaussian weight for competition among service sites, a friction coefficient, distances along a street network based on the Dijkstra’s algorithm and by performing a vectorial analysis. To check the accuracy of the strategy, we used the data from the public sterilization program for the dogs and cats of Bogot´a, Colombia. Since the proposed strategy is independent of the service, it could also be applied to any other public intervention when the capacity of the service is known. The results of the accessibility model were consistent with the sterilization program data, revealing that the western, central and northern zones are the most isolated areas under the sterilization program. Spatial accessibility improvement was sought by relocating the sterilization sites using the maximum coverage with finite demand and the p-median models. The relocation proposed by the maximum coverage model more effectively maximized the spatial accessibility to the sterilization service given the non-uniform distribution of the populations of dogs and cats throughout the city. The implementation of the proposed strategy would provide direct benefits by improving the effectiveness of different public health interventions and the use of financial and human resources.},

	abstract = {Land-use allocation has long been an important area of research in regional science. Land-use patterns are fundamental to the functions of the biosphere, creating interactions that have substantial impacts on the environment. The spatial arrangement of land uses therefore has implications for activity and travel within a region. Balancing development, economic growth, social interaction, and the protection of the natural environment is at the heart of long-term sustainability. Since land-use patterns are spatially explicit in nature, planning and management necessarily must integrate geographical information system and spatial optimization in meaningful ways if efficiency goals and objectives are to be achieved. This article reviews spatial optimization approaches that have been relied upon to support land-use planning. Characteristics of sustainable land use, particularly compactness, contiguity, and compatibility, are discussed and how spatial optimization techniques have addressed these characteristics are detailed. In particular, objectives and constraints in spatial optimization approaches are examined.},

However, many transportation network design models instead focus on maximizing individuals' mobility or the ease of movement within the network. By adapting a space-time prism analysis framework, this paper aims to address a new urban network design problem to maximize the system-wide transportation accessibility between major activity locations, subject to a given highway construction budget. By constructing a time-dependent space-time network, we formulate the problem as a linear integer programming model to maximize the number of accessible activity locations within travel time budget for road users. A Lagrangian relaxation solution framework effectively decomposes the original complex problem into classical subproblems such as knapsack and time-dependent least cost problems. Various examples and discussions are provided to consider the effectiveness of the proposed method in modeling accessibility-enhancement strategies such as congestion mitigation and land use policies.},

Based on the case study, this paper further clarifies the sequential decision-making approach, termed “two-step optimization for spatial accessibility improvement (2SO4SAI).” The first step is to find the best locations to site new facilities by emphasizing accessibility as proximity to the nearest facilities with several alternative objectives under consideration. The second step adjusts the capacities of facilities for minimal inequality in accessibility, where the measure of accessibility accounts for the match ratio of supply and demand and complex spatial interaction between them. The case study illustrates how the two-step optimization method improves both aspects of spatial accessibility for health care access in rural China.},

	abstract = {Background Achieving fair access to healthcare and improving population health are crucial in all settings. Properly staffed and fairly distributed primary health care (PHC) facilities are prerequisites to ensure accessible healthcare services. Nevertheless, availability and accessibility issues are common public health concerns, especially in under-resourced countries including Ethiopia. Measuring inequalities in accessibility of healthcare resources guide policy decisions to improve PHC services and ultimately achieving universal health coverage (UHC). Purpose To assess availability and measure magnitude and trend of inequalities in accessibility of health centre-based PHC resources in Ethiopia during 2015 to 2017. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional population-based analysis of district-level data collected from 16th December 2017 until 24th May 2018. Afar, Dire-Dawa, and Tigray regions were purposefully included in the study to represent the four pastoralist/semi-pastoralist, three urban and four agrarian regions in Ethiopia, respectively. We used ratios, different inequality indices and Gini decomposition techniques to characterise the inequalities. Results In 2017, median of health centres (HCs) per 15,000 inhabitants and their Gini indices (GIs) for Afar, Dire-Dawa, and Tigray were 0.781, 0.566, 0.591 vs. 0.237, 0.280, 0.216 respectively. Median overall skilled health workers (SHWs) per 10,000 inhabitants were 5.250, 7.539, and 6.246, respectively. These accounted for 11.80\%, 16.94\% and 14.04\% of the WHO target of 44.5 to achieve SDGs. The corresponding GIs for the regions were 0.347, 0.186 and 0.175. Despite a higher overall SHWs inequality in the urban districts of Tigray (GI = 0.301), only Tigray showed significant inequality reductions in GHE (p {\textless} 0.001) and in all categories of SHWs (p {\textless} 0.05). Conclusions Our analysis provided a clear picture of availability and inequalities in PHC resources across three regions in Ethiopia. Identifying contributing factors to low densities and high inequalities of SHWs may help improve PHC services nationwide, along with pathway towards UHC.},

An example of the use of LP in land-use planning is described, with minimizing rural unemployment as the main goal. Technical, financial and ecological constraints are established to show the influence of several limitations on achieving the optimal solution. LP makes it possible to achieve optimal land-use, where the objective is maximized and the constraints respected. LP can also be used to simulate different planning scenarios, by modifying both the objective function coefficients and the constraints. The integration of LP and GIS is presented in two phases: (i) acquisition of attribute data for the LP model, and (ii) modelling and mapping the results.},

The potential for optimization was assessed by the percentage difference between the total distances traveled under the current situation and the optimum solution obtained. The results with the optimized situation included a decrease of 293,246km (14.4\%) in the total monthly distance traveled in the network, or a mean reduction of 13.02km per procedure performed, compared to the current distance traveled. This gain would be obtained by redistribution of the municipalities of origin and the referral services' capacity to supply procedures.

We used the integrated floating catchment area (iFCA) method to analyze spatial accessibility of general inpatient care (internal medicine, surgery and neurology) on national level in Germany determining an accessibility index (AI) by integrating distances, hospital beds and morbidity data. The analysis of 358 million distances between hospitals and population locations revealed clusters of lower accessibility indices in areas in north east Germany. There was a correlation of urbanity and accessibility up to r = 0.31 (p {\textless} 0.001). Furthermore, 10\% of the population lived in areas with significant clusters of low spatial accessibility for internal medicine and surgery (neurology: 20\%). The analysis revealed the highest accessibility for heart failure (AI = 7.33) and the lowest accessibility for stroke (AI = 0.69). The method applied proofed to reveal important aspects of spatial accessibility i.e. geographic variations that need to be addressed. However, for the majority of the German population, accessibility of general inpatient care was either high or at least not significantly low, which suggests rather adequate allocation of hospital resources for most parts of Germany.},

The index highlights, on a national scale, areas of cumulative health disadvantages.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: This paper compares access to primary and specialty care in three metropolitan regions of France: Ile de France (IDF), Nord-Pas-de-Calais (NPC) and Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur (PACA); and identifies the factors that contribute to disparities in access to care within and among these regions.
METHODS: To assess access to primary care, we compare variation among residence-based, age-adjusted hospital discharge rates for ambulatory care sensitive conditions (ASC). To assess access on one dimension of specialty care, we compare residence-based, age-adjusted hospital discharge rates for revascularization - bypass surgery and angioplasty - among patients diagnosed with ischemic heart disease (IHD). In addition, for each region we rely on a multilevel generalized linear mixed effect model to identify a range of individual and area-level factors that affect the discharge rates for ASC and revascularization.
RESULTS: In comparison with other large metropolitan regions, in France, access to primary care is greater in Paris and its surrounding region (IDF) than in NPC but worse than in PACA. With regard to revascularization, after controlling for the burden of IHD, use of services is highest in PACA followed by IDF and NPC. In all three regions, disparities in access are much greater for revascularization than for ASC. Residents of low-income areas and those who are treated in public hospitals have poorer access to primary care and revascularizations. In addition, the odds of hospitalization for ASC and revascularization are higher for men. Finally, people who are treated in public hospitals, have poorer access to primary care and revascularization services than those who are admitted for ASC and revascularization services in private hospitals.
CONCLUSIONS: Within each region, we find significant income disparities among geographic areas in access to primary care as well as revascularization. Even within a national health insurance system that minimizes the financial barriers to health care and has one of the highest rates of spending on health care in Europe, the challenge of minimizing these disparities remains.},

	abstract = {Objective To better determine the relationship between spatial access to colonoscopy and colorectal cancer (CRC) outcomes, our objective was to examine the agreement of the classic, enhanced, and variable two-step floating catchment area (2SFCA) methods in evaluating spatial access to colonoscopy and to compare the predictive validity of each method related to late-stage CRC. 2SFCA methods simultaneously consider supply/demand of services and impedance (ie, travel time). Data Sources Colonoscopy provider locations were obtained from the South Carolina Ambulatory Surgery Database. ZIP code tabulation area (ZCTA) level population estimates and area-level poverty level were obtained from the American Community Survey. Rurality was determined by the United States Department of Agriculture's Rural-Urban Commuting Area codes. Individual-level CRC data were obtained from the South Carolina Central Cancer Registry. Study Design Using the classic, enhanced, and variable 2SFCA methods, we calculated ZCTA-level spatial access to colonoscopy. We assessed agreement between the three methods by calculating Spearman's rank coefficients and weighted Kappas (Κ). Global and Local Moran's I were used to assess spatial clustering of accessibility scores across 2SFCA methods. We performed multilevel logistic regression analyses to examine the association between spatial accessibility to colonoscopy, area- and individual-level factors, and late-stage CRC. Principal Findings We found strong agreement (Weighted Κ = 0.82; 95\% CI = 0.79-0.86) and identified similar clustering patterns with the classic and enhanced 2SFCA methods. There was negligible agreement among the classic/enhanced 2SFCA and the variable 2SFCA. Across all 2SFCA methods, regression models showed that spatial access to colonoscopy, rurality, and poverty level were not associated with greater odds of late-stage CRC, though Black race was associated with late-stage CRC across all models. Conclusions None of the 2SFCA methods showed an association with late-stage CRC. Future studies should explore which elements (spatial or nonspatial) of access to care have the greatest impact on CRC outcomes.},

	abstract = {Access to cancer care facilities is recognized as affecting the long-term health and well-being of cancer patients; however, little is known about spatial accessibility to specialized cancer therapy centers in Saudi Arabia. This study has estimated the spatial accessibility to cancer care facilities in Saudi Arabia in terms of travel time, and assessed the associations between the travel time to specialized cancer therapy centers and geographic sectors, demographic characteristics, the diagnosed number of cancer cases (CCs) and the cancer crude incidence rate at the city level. A geographic information system (GIS) and spatial analysis were used to estimate spatial accessibility (i.e., travel time) using street network distance, adjusted by road speed limit. Incidences of diagnosed cancer were obtained from the Saudi Cancer Registry (SCR) from January 1998 to December 2004. The spatial cancer incidence database was designed and developed at the city level based on aggregated individual CCs. Spatial access to specialized cancer care facilities appears to be sufficient for a proportion of the Saudi population. For the total Saudi population during the study period, the median travel time to the closest specialized cancer care facility was 212 min, with an interquartile range (IQR) of 97-315 min. Travel times of 2 h to the closest specialized cancer center were estimated for 57\% of the Saudi population in 2004. There were variances in access, and there were population groups in the southern and northern regions that had limited access to these settings. These areas should be the primary targets for the development of regional cancer services.},

	abstract = {The p-median and flow-refueling models are two of the more popular models for optimal location of alternative-fuel stations. The p-median model, one of the most widely used location models of any kind, locates p facilities and allocates demand nodes to them to minimize total weighted distance traveled. In comparison, the flow-refueling location model (FRLM) is a path-based demand model that locates p stations to maximize the number of trips on their shortest paths that can be refueled. For a path to be considered refuelable, one or more stations must be located on the path in a way that allows the round trip to be completed without running out of fuel, given the vehicle driving range. In this paper, we analyze how well the facilities located by each model perform on the other’s objective function on road networks in Florida. While each objective function degrades somewhat when facilities are located by the other model, the stations located by the flow-refueling model generally do better on the p-median objective than the stations located by the p-median model do on the flow-refueling objective. This difference between the two models is even more pronounced at the state scale than at the metropolitan scale. In addition, the optimal locations for the FRLM tend to be more much more stable as p increases than those located by the p-median model.},

Improving the quality of care requires a steady adaptation of treatment modalities together with equity of access to dialysis facilities. We explored the ability of the health system to cope with the demand of ESRD care. An analysis of a 5-year follow-up cohort of ESRD patients in the Limousin region, France, was performed. Data were entered in the Multi-Source Information System of the Renal Epidemiology and Information Network (REIN). The participation rate of centres was complete. We analysed patient characteristics, therapeutic options and driving time to reach dialysis facilities. We investigated geographic accessibility by defining areas within 45 minutes from dialysis units. We constructed scenarios to assess the impact of health care reorganization. In-centre haemodialysis units represented 73\% of treatment modalities. One quarter of patients lived at more than 45 minutes of their dialysis unit. Based on a scenario of creating an additional In-centre unit, the number of patients living far from their centre would decrease by 31\%. This study emphasizes important issues related to ESRD epidemiology, comorbidity and health care planning. It stimulates the development of new scenarios allowing the assessment of equity in accessing health care facilities.},

Gravity-based spatial access models have been widely used to estimate spatial access to healthcare services. Among them, the floating catchment area (FCA) methods have been proved to be informative and helpful to the designation of Health Professional Shortage Areas (HPSAs). This article integrates the Huff Model with the FCA method to articulate population selection on services. Through the proposed approach, population demand on healthcare services is adjusted by a Huff Model-based selection probability that reflects the impacts of both distance impedance and service site capacity. The new approach moderates the over- or under-estimating of population demand that occurred with previous methods. Furthermore, the method uses a continuous distance impedance weight function instead of the arbitrarily defined subzones of previous studies. A case study of spatial access to primary care in Springfield, MO, showed that the proposed method can effectively moderate the population demand on service sites and therefore can generate more reliable spatial access measures.},

Logistic regression was used to identify the variables associated with advanced extent of the disease at diagnosis. Adverse influences on survival were investigated using Cox proportional hazards models. Controlling for age and gender, Māori and Pacific peoples' ethnicity was strongly associated with poorer survival, partly because ethnicity was also linked to the likelihood of advanced disease at diagnosis. Living in a deprived area was related to later stage presentation and poorer survival of people with melanoma, but there was no other evidence that living in a deprived area or in a remote location were associated with later stage presentation. Some disease-specific trends in survival were observed. Colorectal and lung cancers were more likely to be fatal for people living in deprived areas, survival from prostate cancer was poor for men living remote from primary care, and people with colorectal, breast and prostate cancers had adverse survival chances if they lived distant from a cancer centre.},

In France patients living between 20 and 90min from the nearest cancer unit tended to have a poorer survival, although this was not statistically significant. In England, the better prognosis observed for remote patients can be explained by associations with material deprivation; distance to health services alone did not affect survival whilst material deprivation level had a major influence, with lower survival for patients living in deprived areas. Increases in travel times to health services in France were associated with poorer survival rates. The pattern of this influence seems to follow an inverse U distribution, i.e. maximal for average travel times.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to measure the extent to which geographic residency status and the social environment are associated with disease stage at diagnosis, receipt of treatment, and five-year survival for patients diagnosed with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
METHODS AND MATERIALS: This study was a retrospective cohort study of the Georgia Comprehensive Cancer Registry (GCCR) for incident cases of NSCLC diagnosed in the state. Multilevel logistic models were employed for five outcome variables: unstaged and late stage disease at diagnosis; receipt of treatment (surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation); and survival following diagnosis. The social and geographical variables of interest were census tract (CT) poverty level, CT-level educational attainment, and CT-level geographic residency status.
RESULTS: Compared to urban residents, rural and suburban residents had increased odds of unstaged disease (suburban OR=1.23, 95\% CI: 1.11-1.37; rural OR=1.63, 95\% CI: 1.45-1.83). In this study, rural participants had lower odds of receiving radiotherapy (OR=0.89, 95\% CI: 0.82-0.96) and chemotherapy (OR=0.92, 95\% CI: 0.85-0.99). Living in CTs with lower educational levels was associated with decreasing odds of receiving both surgery (lowest educational level OR=0.67, 95\% CI: 0.59-0.75) and chemotherapy (lowest educational level OR=0.74, 95\% CI: 0.68-0.81). Living in areas with higher concentration of deprivation (high level of deprivation HR=1.04, 95\% CI: 1.01-1.09) and lower levels of education (lowest educational level HR=1.12, 95\% CI: 1.07-1.17) was associated with poorer survival. Rural residents did not show poorer survival when treatment was controlled and they even presented a lower risk of death for early stage disease (HR=0.90, 95\% CI: 0.82-0.99).
CONCLUSION: This study concludes that where NSCLC patients live can, to some extent, explain treatment and prognostic disparities. Public health practitioners and policy makers should be cognizant of the importance of where people live and shift their efforts to improve lung cancer outcomes in rural areas and neighborhoods with concentrated poverty.},

However, these models are inadequate in informing health resource allocation work due to their inappropriate assumption of healthcare demand. For the purpose of effective healthcare resource planning, this article proposes a three-step floating catchment area (3SFCA) method to minimize the healthcare-demand overestimation problem. Specifically, a spatial impedance-based competition scheme is incorporated into the enhanced two-step floating catchment area (E2SFCA) method to account for a reasonable model of healthcare supply and demand. A case study of spatial access to primary care physicians along the Austin–San Antonio corridor area in central Texas showed that the proposed method effectively minimizes the overestimation of healthcare demand and reflects a more balanced geographic pattern of spatial access than E2SFCA. In addition, by using an adjusted spatial access index, the 3SFCA method indicates strong potential for identifying health professional shortage areas. The study concludes that 3SFCA is a promising method to provide health professionals and decision makers with useful healthcare accessibility information.},

	abstract = {In recent years, spectral clustering has become one of the most popular modern clustering algorithms. It is simple to implement, can be solved efficiently by standard linear algebra software, and very often outperforms traditional clustering algorithms such as the k-means algorithm. On the first glance spectral clustering appears slightly mysterious, and it is not obvious to see why it works at all and what it really does. The goal of this tutorial is to give some intuition on to those questions. We describe different graph Laplacians and their basic properties, present the most common spectral clustering algorithms, and derive those algorithms from scratch by several different approaches. Advantages and disadvantages of the different spectral clustering algorithms are discussed.},

We expect interactions between allocation targets to be important and therefore propose to learn the reward structure for near-optimal allocation policies with a GNN. By relaxing the resource constraint, we can employ gradient-based optimization in contrast to more standard evolutionary algorithms. Our algorithm is motivated by a problem in modern astronomy, where one needs to select-based on limited initial information-among \$10{\textasciicircum}9\$ galaxies those whose detailed measurement will lead to optimal inference of the composition of the universe. Our technique presents a way of flexibly learning an allocation strategy by only requiring forward simulators for the physics of interest and the measurement process. We anticipate that our technique will also find applications in a range of resource allocation problems.},

However, despite the prevalence of the capacity constraint in the recommendation process, the existing recommendation methods are not designed to optimize for respecting such a constraint. Towards closing this gap, we propose Recommendation with Capacity Constraints – a framework that optimizes for both recommendation accuracy and expected item usage that respects the capacity constraints. We show how to apply our method to three state-of-the-art latent factor recommendation models: probabilistic matrix factorization (PMF), bayesian personalized ranking (BPR) for item recommendation, and geographical matrix factorization (GeoMF) for POI recommendation. Our experiments indicate that our framework is e ective for providing good recommendations while taking the limited resources into consideration. Interestingly, our methods are shown in some cases to further improve the top-N recommendation quality of the respective unconstrained models.},

	abstract = {As an effective way to help users find attractive locations and meet their individual needs, point-of-interest (POI) recommendation has become an important application in location-based social networks (LBSNs). Although the geographical influence has been reported as an effective factor for improving POI recommendation accuracy, previous work mainly models it from the user perspective instead of location perspective. Intuitively, neighboring POIs tend to be visited by similar users, which implies that modeling geographical relationships from a location perspective can simulate users’ behavior more reasonably. Moreover, different from traditional recommendation problems, users in LBSNs often express their interests only by checking in different POIs, which is a kind of implicit feedback. In other words, we can easily get the POIs that the users have visited, but it is hard to get the ones that the users do not like. We cannot use a common approach to distinguish these negative values directly. Based on the above observations, this work concentrates on exploiting the geographical relationships among POIs from a location perspective for implicit problem, where a location neighborhood-aware weighted probabilistic matrix factorization is proposed (L-WMF). To be specific, the weighted probabilistic matrix factorization (WMF) that can deal with implicit feedback is first introduced as our basic POI recommendation method. Then, we incorporate the geographical relationships among POIs into the WMF as the regularization terms to exploit the geographical characteristics from a location perspective. Finally, we conduct several experiments to evaluate our L-WMF method on two real-world datasets, and the experimental results indicate that the L-WMF is more effective and can reach better performance than other related methods.},

Using cell phone location data, as well as data from two online location-based social networks, we aim to understand what basic laws govern human motion and dynamics. We ﬁnd that humans experience a combination of periodic movement that is geographically limited and seemingly random jumps correlated with their social networks. Short-ranged travel is periodic both spatially and temporally and not effected by the social network structure, while long-distance travel is more inﬂuenced by social network ties. We show that social relationships can explain about 10\% to 30\% of all human movement, while periodic behavior explains 50\% to 70\%. Based on our ﬁndings, we develop a model of human mobility that combines periodic short range movements with travel due to the social network structure. We show that our model reliably predicts the locations and dynamics of future human movement and gives an order of magnitude better performance than present models of human mobility.},

In this paper, we propose SEALs - a ﬁnegrained preference-aware location search framework leveraging the crowdsourced traces in LBSNs. We ﬁrst collect user check-ins and tips from Foursquare and use them as direct user feedback on locations. Second, we extract users’ sentiment about locations and associated entities from tips to characterize their ﬁne-grained location preference. Third, we incorporate such ﬁne-grained user preference into personalized location ranking using tensor factorization techniques.

	abstract = {Background Studying social disparities in health implies the ability to measure them accurately, to compare them between different areas or countries and to follow trends over time. This study proposes a method for constructing a French European deprivation index, which will be replicable in several European countries and is related to an individual deprivation indicator constructed from a European survey specifically designed to study deprivation.
Methods and Results Using individual data from the European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions survey, goods/services indicated by individuals as being fundamental needs, the lack of which reflect deprivation, were selected. From this definition, which is specific to a cultural context, an individual deprivation indicator was constructed by selecting fundamental needs associated both with objective and subjective poverty. Next, the authors selected among variables available both in the European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions survey and French national census those best reflecting individual experience of deprivation using multivariate logistic regression. An ecological measure of deprivation was provided for all the smallest French geographical units. Preliminary validation showed a higher association between the French European Deprivation Index (EDI) score and both income and education than the Townsend index, partly ensuring its ability to measure individual socioeconomic status.
Conclusion This index, which is specific to a particular cultural and social policy context, could be replicated in 25 other European countries, thereby allowing European comparisons. EDI could also be reproducible over time. EDI could prove to be a relevant tool in evidence-based policy-making for measuring and reducing social disparities in health issues and even outside the medical domain.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Spatial health inequalities have often been analysed in terms of deprivation. The aim of this study was to create an ecological deprivation index and evaluate its association with mortality over the entire mainland France territory. More specifically, the variations with the degree of urbanicity, spatial scale, age, gender and cause of death, which influence the association between mortality and deprivation, have been described.
METHODS: The deprivation index, 'FDep99', was developed at the 'commune'(smallest administrative unit in France) level as the first component of a principal component analysis of four socioeconomic variables. Proxies of the Carstairs and Townsend indices were calculated for comparison. The spatial association between FDep99 and mortality was studied using five different spatial scales, and by degree of urbanicity (five urban unit categories), age, gender and cause of death, over the period 1997-2001. 'Avoidable' causes of death were also considered for subjects aged less than 65 years. They were defined as causes related to risk behaviour and primary prevention (alcohol, smoking, accidents).
RESULTS: The association between the FDep99 index and mortality was positive and quasi-log-linear, for all geographic scales. The standardized mortality ratio (SMR) was 24\% higher for the communes of the most deprived quintile than for those of the least deprived quintile. The between-urban unit category and between-région heterogeneities of the log-linear associations were not statistically significant. The association was positive for all the categories studied and was significantly greater for subjects aged less than 65 years, for men, and for 'avoidable' mortality. The amplitude and regularity of the associations between mortality and the Townsend and Carstairs indices were lower.
CONCLUSION: The deprivation index proposed reflects a major part of spatial socioeconomic heterogeneity, in a homogeneous manner over the whole country. The index may be routinely used by healthcare authorities to observe, analyse, and manage spatial health inequalities.},

Breast cancer induces sequelae even years after diagnosis, but little is currently known about long-term sequelae patterns. This study aimed to (1) assess the evolution of the main sequelae and treatment two and five years after diagnosis in women with early-stage breast cancer, (2) explore patterns of sequelae associated with given sociodemographic, clinical, and lifestyle factors. Our results show that six main classes of sequelae were identified and remain constant over time except for fatigue and cognitive sequelae. The latent class analysis identified two main classes of sequelae (functional and esthetic patterns) and we have highlighted that different risk factors such as treatment, sociodemographic level, and physical activity level were associated with an increased risk of long-term sequelae.

Abstract
Breast cancer (BC) remains complex for women both physically and psychologically. The objectives of this study were to (1) assess the evolution of the main sequelae and treatment two and five years after diagnosis in women with early-stage breast cancer, (2) explore patterns of sequelae associated with given sociodemographic, clinical, and lifestyle factors. The current analysis was based on 654 localized BC patients enrolled in the French nationwide longitudinal survey “vie après cancer” VICAN (January–June 2010). Information about study participants was collected at enrollment, two and five years after diagnosis. Changes over time of the main sequelae were analyzed and latent class analysis was performed to identify patterns of sequelae related to BC five years after diagnosis. The mean age (±SD) of study participants at inclusion was 49.7 (±10.5) years old. Six main classes of sequelae were identified two years and five years post-diagnosis (functional, pain, esthetic, fatigue, psychological, and gynecological). A significant decrease was observed for fatigue (p = 0.03) and an increase in cognitive sequelae was reported (p = 0.03). Two latent classes were identified—functional and esthetic patterns. Substantial sequelae remain up to five years after BC diagnosis. Changes in patient care pathways are needed to identify BC patients at a high risk.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Background: Cancer caused nearly 10 million deaths in 2020. While most of the ongoing research focuses on finding new treatments, accessibility to oncology care receives less attention. However, studies showed that access to health services plays a key role in cancer survival. Spatial accessibility methods have been successfully applied to measure accessibility to primary care. Yet, little research focused on oncology care specifically. Methods: We focused on care centers with medicine, surgery, or obstetric activity in metropolitan France. We ran a clustering algorithm to automatically label the hospitals in terms of oncology specialization. Then, we computed an accessibility score to these hospitals for every municipality in metropolitan France. Finally, we proposed an optimization algorithm to increase the oncology accessibility by identifying care centers to grow. Results: We labelled 1,662 care centers into 8 clusters. Half of them were eligible for oncology care and 118 centers were identified as experts. We computed the oncology accessibility score for 34,877 municipalities in metropolitan France. Half of the population lived in the top 20\% accessibility areas, and 6.3\% in the bottom 20\% zones. Accessibility was higher near dense cities, where the experts care centers were located. By combining the care centers clusters and the accessibility distributions, our optimization algorithm could identify hospitals to grow, to reduce accessibility disparities. Conclusion: Most of the lowest accessibility zones were sparsely populated rural areas, with no oncology specialized care centers nearby. While such areas were hard to improve, accessibility in suburban areas with intermediate level care centers could be addressed more easily. This accessibility score was deliberately non-specific to cancer type nor to the kind of stays, but it could be adapted to more specific scenarios. We packaged our method into a web application allowing the users to run the algorithms with various parameters and visualize the results{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Interacting systems are prevalent in nature, from dynamical systems in physics to complex societal dynamics. The interplay of components can give rise to complex behavior, which can often be explained using a simple model of the system's constituent parts. In this work, we introduce the neural relational inference (NRI) model: an unsupervised model that learns to infer interactions while simultaneously learning the dynamics purely from observational data. Our model takes the form of a variational auto-encoder, in which the latent code represents the underlying interaction graph and the reconstruction is based on graph neural networks. In experiments on simulated physical systems, we show that our NRI model can accurately recover ground-truth interactions in an unsupervised manner. We further demonstrate that we can find an interpretable structure and predict complex dynamics in real motion capture and sports tracking data.},

	abstract = {The modern science of networks has brought significant advances to our understanding of complex systems. One of the most relevant features of graphs representing real systems is community structure, or clustering, i.e. the organization of vertices in clusters, with many edges joining vertices of the same cluster and comparatively few edges joining vertices of different clusters. Such clusters, or communities, can be considered as fairly independent compartments of a graph, playing a similar role like, e.g., the tissues or the organs in the human body. Detecting communities is of great importance in sociology, biology and computer science, disciplines where systems are often represented as graphs. This problem is very hard and not yet satisfactorily solved, despite the huge effort of a large interdisciplinary community of scientists working on it over the past few years. We will attempt a thorough exposition of the topic, from the definition of the main elements of the problem, to the presentation of most methods developed, with a special focus on techniques designed by statistical physicists, from the discussion of crucial issues like the significance of clustering and how methods should be tested and compared against each other, to the description of applications to real networks.},

OBJECTIVE: To describe monthly reimbursed expenditure during the last year of life among cancer patients, by performing detailed analysis according to type of expenditure and the person's age.
METHOD: Data were derived from the Système national des données en santé (SNDS) [national health data system], which comprises information on ambulatory and hospital care. Analyses focused on general scheme beneficiaries (77\% of the French population) treated for cancer who died in 2015.
RESULTS: Average reimbursed expenditure during the last year of life was €34,300 per person in 2015, including €21,100 (62\%) for hospital expenditure. "Short-stays hospital" and "rehabilitation units" stays expenditure were €14,700 and €2000, respectively. Monthly expenditure increased regularly towards the end of life, increasing from 12 months before death €2000 to €5200 1 month before death. The highest levels of expenditure did not concern the oldest people, as average reimbursed expenditure was €50,300 for people 18-59 years versus €25,600 for people 80-90 years. Out-of-pocket payments varied only slightly according to age, but increased towards the end of life.
CONCLUSION: A marked growth of HCE was observed during the last 4 months of life, mainly driven by hospital expenditure, with a more marked growth for younger people.},

METHODS: We processed the French Système National des Données de Santé (SNDS) database using an algorithm combining the type of surgical procedure and the International Classification of Diseases to retrieve all cases of meningiomas operated between 2007 and 2017. A survival analysis was performed.
RESULTS: This nationwide study found 28 773 patients of which 75 \% were female. Median age at surgery was 59 years, IQR[49-68]. Cranial convexity (24.4 \%) and middle skull base (21.7 \%) were the most common locations. 91.3 \% of the tumours were benign and 2.6 \% malignant.7.5 \% of the patients underwent redo surgery, 9.1 \% radiotherapy (RT) and 3.2 \% stereotactic radiosurgery for recurrence. Median follow-up was 5.3 years 95 \% CI [5.24-5.35]. 0.64 \% of the patients died within a month of surgery and 2.1 \% within a year. Overall survival (OS) rates at 5 and 10 years respectively were: 92.6 \%, 95 \%CI[92.3, 93] and 85 \%, 95 \%CI[84.3, 85.8].

CONCLUSION: In this registry-based study, OS after meningioma surgery is good and is even better in women, younger adults and those with convexity and benign tumour.

This study aimed to evaluate the impact of centralizing hospital support functions such as administration, quality monitoring, procurement, and insurance on patient outcomes in a French regional hospital group.
Study design
A before-after study was conducted within a medium-sized hospital in a rural region of France including 87,373 hospital stays between 2013 and 2017.
Methods
The intervention tested was the centralization of support functions: administration, quality monitoring, procurement, and insurance. The outcomes analyzed were patient mortality, 30 day readmissions and average length of stay.
Results
The odds ratio (OR) for patient mortality after centralization was 0.99 (95\%CI, 0.92 to 1.06), and 0.94 (95\%CI, 0.90 to 0.96) for readmissions. The multiplicative factor for average length of stay was 0.93 (95\%CI 0.92–0.94).
Conclusions
There was an increase in measured quality of care after the intervention. This study highlights the complexity of assessing the impact of hospital-level centralization on quality-of-care indicators.},

Existing techniques either cannot be scaled to large-scale bipartite graphs that have limited labels or cannot exploit the unique structure of bipartite graphs, which have distinct node features in two domains. Thus, we propose Cascade Bipartite Graph Neural Networks, Cascade-BGNN, a novel node representation learning for bipartite graphs that is domain-consistent, self-supervised, and efficient. To efficiently aggregate information both across and within the two partitions of a bipartite graph, BGNN utilizes a customized Inter-domain Message Passing (IDMP) and Intra-domain Alignment (IDA), which is our adaptation of adversarial learning, for message aggregation across and within partitions, respectively. BGNN is trained in a self-supervised manner. Moreover, we formulate a multi-layer BGNN in a cascaded training manner to enable multi-hop relationship modeling while improving training efficiency. Extensive experiments on several datasets of varying scales verify the effectiveness and efficiency of BGNN over baselines. Our design is further affirmed through theoretical analysis for domain alignment. The scalability of BGNN is additionally verified through its demonstrated rapid training speed and low memory cost over a large-scale real-world bipartite graph.},

By far most research efforts have focused on homogeneous networks like social networks where vertices are of the same type, or heterogeneous networks like knowledge graphs where vertices (and/or edges) are of different types. There has been relatively little research dedicated to bipartite graphs. Arguably, generic graph embedding methods like node2vec and LINE can also be applied to learn graph embeddings for bipartite graph by ignoring the vertex type information. However, real-world bipartite graphs also concern the relationship between two types of entities, which usually exhibit different properties and patterns from other types of graph structured data. Recently, Graph Neural Networks(GNNs) model has shown its power in addressing graph structured data. In this work, we aim to learn graph representation for bipartite graph with GNN. We evaluate our GNN model on large-scale social network dataset with classification task.},

	abstract = {We propose in this paper a differentiable learning loss between time series, building upon the celebrated dynamic time warping (DTW) discrepancy. Unlike the Euclidean distance, DTW can compare time series of variable size and is robust to shifts or dilatations across the time dimension. To compute DTW, one typically solves a minimal-cost alignment problem between two time series using dynamic programming. Our work takes advantage of a smoothed formulation of DTW, called soft-DTW, that computes the soft-minimum of all alignment costs. We show in this paper that soft-DTW is a differentiable loss function, and that both its value and gradient can be computed with quadratic time/space complexity (DTW has quadratic time but linear space complexity). We show that this regularization is particularly well suited to average and cluster time series under the DTW geometry, a task for which our proposal significantly outperforms existing baselines. Next, we propose to tune the parameters of a machine that outputs time series by minimizing its fit with ground-truth labels in a soft-DTW sense.},

We propose in this work a new family of optimal transportation distances that look at transportation problems from a maximum-entropy perspective. We smooth the classical optimal transportation problem with an entropic regularization term, and show that the resulting optimum is also a distance which can be computed through Sinkhorn-Knopp's matrix scaling algorithm at a speed that is several orders of magnitude faster than that of transportation solvers. We also report improved performance over classical optimal transportation distances on the MNIST benchmark problem.},

	abstract = {Sorting an array is a fundamental routine in machine learning, one that is used to compute rank-based statistics, cumulative distribution functions (CDFs), quantiles, or to select closest neighbors and labels. The sorting function is however piece-wise constant (the sorting permutation of a vector does not change if the entries of that vector are infinitesimally perturbed) and therefore has no gradient information to back-propagate. We propose a framework to sort elements that is algorithmically differentiable. We leverage the fact that sorting can be seen as a particular instance of the optimal transport (OT) problem on \${\textbackslash}mathbb\{R\}\$, from input values to a predefined array of sorted values (e.g. \$1,2,{\textbackslash}dots,n\$ if the input array has \$n\$ elements). Building upon this link , we propose generalized CDFs and quantile operators by varying the size and weights of the target presorted array. Because this amounts to using the so-called Kantorovich formulation of OT, we call these quantities K-sorts, K-CDFs and K-quantiles. We recover differentiable algorithms by adding to the OT problem an entropic regularization, and approximate it using a few Sinkhorn iterations. We call these operators S-sorts, S-CDFs and S-quantiles, and use them in various learning settings: we benchmark them against the recently proposed neuralsort [Grover et al. 2019], propose applications to quantile regression and introduce differentiable formulations of the top-k accuracy that deliver state-of-the art performance.},

	abstract = {Optimal transport (OT) theory can be informally described using the words of the French mathematician Gaspard Monge (1746-1818): A worker with a shovel in hand has to move a large pile of sand lying on a construction site. The goal of the worker is to erect with all that sand a target pile with a prescribed shape (for example, that of a giant sand castle). Naturally, the worker wishes to minimize her total effort, quantified for instance as the total distance or time spent carrying shovelfuls of sand. Mathematicians interested in OT cast that problem as that of comparing two probability distributions, two different piles of sand of the same volume. They consider all of the many possible ways to morph, transport or reshape the first pile into the second, and associate a "global" cost to every such transport, using the "local" consideration of how much it costs to move a grain of sand from one place to another. Recent years have witnessed the spread of OT in several fields, thanks to the emergence of approximate solvers that can scale to sizes and dimensions that are relevant to data sciences. Thanks to this newfound scalability, OT is being increasingly used to unlock various problems in imaging sciences (such as color or texture processing), computer vision and graphics (for shape manipulation) or machine learning (for regression, classification and density fitting). This short book reviews OT with a bias toward numerical methods and their applications in data sciences, and sheds lights on the theoretical properties of OT that make it particularly useful for some of these applications.},

This formulation facilitates a practical annealing strategy for label assignment and allows for the inclusion of prior knowledge on class proportions via flexible upper bound constraints. The solutions to these assignment problems can be efficiently approximated using Sinkhorn iteration, thus enabling their use in the inner loop of standard stochastic optimization algorithms.

In contrast, we study the inverse problem of estimating matching affinity based on the observation of the joint distribution, using an entropic regularization of the problem. To accommodate high dimensionality of the data, we propose a novel method that incorporates a nuclear norm regularization which effectively enforces a rank constraint on the affinity matrix.

It enables to cast the OT computation as a differentiable and unconstrained convex optimization problem, which can be efficiently solved using the Sinkhorn algorithm. However, entropy keeps the transportation plan strictly positive and therefore completely dense, unlike unregularized OT. This lack of sparsity can be problematic in applications where the transportation plan itself is of interest. In this paper, we explore regularizing the primal and dual OT formulations with a strongly convex term, which corresponds to relaxing the dual and primal constraints with smooth approximations. We show how to incorporate squared \$2\$-norm and group lasso regularizations within that framework, leading to sparse and group-sparse transportation plans. On the theoretical side, we bound the approximation error introduced by regularizing the primal and dual formulations. Our results suggest that, for the regularized primal, the approximation error can often be smaller with squared \$2\$-norm than with entropic regularization.

We address this issue by stating a valid differentiation theorem in the case of entropic regularized transport and specify conditions under which existence is ensured. By exploiting the discrete nature of empirical data, we formulate the gradient in a semi-discrete setting and propose an algorithm for the optimization of the generative model parameters. Finally, we illustrate numerically the advantage of the proposed framework.},

First, we categorize the systems by the influential factors check-in characteristics, including the geographical information, social relationship, temporal influence, and content indications. Second, we categorize the systems by the methodology, including systems modeled by fused methods and joint methods. Third, we categorize the systems as general POI recommendation and successive POI recommendation by subtle differences in the recommendation task whether to be bias to the recent check-in.

In SPA, patients submit their ratings in a protected form without revealing any information about their data, and the computation of recommendations proceeds over the protected data using secure multi-party computation techniques. In ACA, patients submit their ratings in the clear, but no link between a submission and patient data can be made. We discuss various aspects of both architectures including techniques for ensuring reliability of computed recommendations and system performance, and provide their comparison.},

The recommender system is the core component of the social network named HealthNet (HN). The recommendation algorithm first computes similarities among patients, and then generates a ranked list of doctors and hospitals suitable for a given patient profile, by exploiting health data shared by the community. Accordingly, the HN user can find her most similar patients, look how they cured their diseases, and receive suggestions for solving her problem. Currently, the alpha version of HN is available only for Italian users, but in the next future we want to extend the platform to other languages. We organized three focus groups with patients, practitioners, and health organizations in order to obtain comments and suggestions. All of them proved to be very enthusiastic by using the HN platform.},

In this paper, we develop a novel healthcare recommendation system called iDoctor, which is based on hybrid matrix factorization methods. iDoctor differs from previous work in the following aspects: (1) emotional offset of user reviews can be unveiled by sentiment analysis and be utilized to revise original user ratings; (2) user preference and doctor feature are extracted by Latent Dirichlet Allocation and incorporated into conventional matrix factorization. We compare iDoctor with previous healthcare recommendation methods using real datasets. The experimental results show that iDoctor provides a higher predication rating and increases the accuracy of healthcare recommendation significantly.},

However, the scarcity of the check-in data, a type of implicit feedback data, poses a severe challenge for existing POI recommendation methods. Moreover, different types of context information about POIs are available and how to leverage them becomes another challenge. In this paper, we propose a ranking based geographical factorization method, called Rank-GeoFM, for POI recommendation, which addresses the two challenges. In the proposed model, we consider that the check-in frequency characterizes users' visiting preference and learn the factorization by ranking the POIs correctly. In our model, POIs both with and without check-ins will contribute to learning the ranking and thus the data sparsity problem can be alleviated. In addition, our model can easily incorporate different types of context information, such as the geographical influence and temporal influence. We propose a stochastic gradient descent based algorithm to learn the factorization. Experiments on publicly available datasets under both user-POI setting and user-time-POI setting have been conducted to test the effectiveness of the proposed method. Experimental results under both settings show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods significantly in terms of recommendation accuracy.},

	abstract = {The ability to compare two degenerate probability distributions (i.e. two probability distributions supported on two distinct low-dimensional manifolds living in a much higher-dimensional space) is a crucial problem arising in the estimation of generative models for high-dimensional observations such as those arising in computer vision or natural language. It is known that optimal transport metrics can represent a cure for this problem, since they were specifically designed as an alternative to information divergences to handle such problematic scenarios. Unfortunately, training generative machines using OT raises formidable computational and statistical challenges, because of (i) the computational burden of evaluating OT losses, (ii) the instability and lack of smoothness of these losses, (iii) the difficulty to estimate robustly these losses and their gradients in high dimension. This paper presents the first tractable computational method to train large scale generative models using an optimal transport loss, and tackles these three issues by relying on two key ideas: (a) entropic smoothing, which turns the original OT loss into one that can be computed using Sinkhorn fixed point iterations; (b) algorithmic (automatic) differentiation of these iterations. These two approximations result in a robust and differentiable approximation of the OT loss with streamlined GPU execution. Entropic smoothing generates a family of losses interpolating between Wasserstein (OT) and Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD), thus allowing to find a sweet spot leveraging the geometry of OT and the favorable high-dimensional sample complexity of MMD which comes with unbiased gradient estimates. The resulting computational architecture complements nicely standard deep network generative models by a stack of extra layers implementing the loss function.},

We show that this criterion extends standard crossentropy minimization to an optimal transport problem, which we solve efficiently for millions of input images and thousands of labels using a fast variant of the Sinkhorn-Knopp algorithm. The resulting method is able to self-label visual data so as to train highly competitive image representations without manual labels. Our method achieves state of the art representation learning performance for AlexNet and ResNet-50 on SVHN, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet and yields the first self-supervised AlexNet that outperforms the supervised Pascal VOC detection baseline.

	abstract = {Unsupervised image representations have significantly reduced the gap with supervised pretraining, notably with the recent achievements of contrastive learning methods. These contrastive methods typically work online and rely on a large number of explicit pairwise feature comparisons, which is computationally challenging. In this paper, we propose an online algorithm, SwAV, that takes advantage of contrastive methods without requiring to compute pairwise comparisons. Specifically, our method simultaneously clusters the data while enforcing consistency between cluster assignments produced for different augmentations (or views) of the same image, instead of comparing features directly as in contrastive learning. Simply put, we use a swapped prediction mechanism where we predict the cluster assignment of a view from the representation of another view. Our method can be trained with large and small batches and can scale to unlimited amounts of data. Compared to previous contrastive methods, our method is more memory efficient since it does not require a large memory bank or a special momentum network. In addition, we also propose a new data augmentation strategy, multi-crop, that uses a mix of views with different resolutions in place of two full-resolution views, without increasing the memory or compute requirements much. We validate our findings by achieving 75.3\% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet with ResNet-50, as well as surpassing supervised pretraining on all the considered transfer tasks.},

Often the underlying cost criterion is unknown, or only partly known, and the observed optimal solutions are corrupted by noise. In this paper we propose a systematic approach to infer unknown costs from noisy observations of optimal transportation plans. The algorithm requires only the ability to solve the forward optimal transport problem, which is a linear program, and to generate random numbers. It has a Bayesian interpretation, and may also be viewed as a form of stochastic optimization. We illustrate the developed methodologies using the example of international migration flows. Reported migration flow data captures (noisily) the number of individuals moving from one country to another in a given period of time. It can be interpreted as a noisy observation of an optimal transportation map, with costs related to the geographical position of countries. We use a graph-based formulation of the problem, with countries at the nodes of graphs and non-zero weighted adjacencies only on edges between countries which share a border. We use the proposed algorithm to estimate the weights, which represent cost of transition, and to quantify uncertainty in these weights.},

In this paper, we propose a novel metric Top-N Fairness to measure the individual fairness of multi-round recommendations of services with capacity constraints. By considering the fact that users are often only affected by top-ranked items in a recommendation, Top-N Fairness only considers a sub-list consisting of top N services. Based on the metric, we design FAST, a Fairness Assured service recommendation STrategy. FAST adjusts the original recommendation list to provide users with recommendation results that guarantee the long-term fairness of multi-round recommendations. We prove the convergence property of the variance of Top-N Fairness of FAST theoretically. FAST is tested on the Yelp dataset and synthetic datasets.

This research is the first of its kind to consider recommendation quantity and repetitive recommendations when creating group recommender systems. In offline stores, physical limitations result in the ability to display only a limited number of items. Quantity and selection of the item is an important decision for offline stores. In this paper, we suggest applying the user-based recommender system, which is capable of determining the best suited recommendation items for each store. This model is evaluated by the MAE, precision, recall, and F1 measures, and shows higher performance than the baseline model. A new performance evaluation measure is also suggested in this research. New quantity precision, quantity recall, and quantity F1 measures consider a penalty for a shortage or excess of the recommendation quantity. Novelty is defined as the proportion of items that the consumer may not have experienced in the recommendation list. Through the use of this novelty measure, we assess the new profit creation effect of the suggested model. Finally, previous research focused on recommendations for online customers, however, we expanded the recommender system to incorporate offline stores. This research is not only an academic contribution to the marketing field, but also practical contribution to offline stores through the usability of a developed offline shopping algorithm.},

	abstract = {One common characteristic of research works focused on fairness evaluation (in machine learning) is that they call for some form of parity (equality) either in treatment—meaning they ignore the information about users’ memberships in protected classes during training—or in impact—by enforcing proportional beneficial outcomes to users in different protected classes. In the recommender systems community, fairness has been studied with respect to both users’ and items’ memberships in protected classes defined by some sensitive attributes (e.g., gender or race for users, revenue in a multi-stakeholder setting for items). Again here, the concept has been commonly interpreted as some form of equality—i.e., the degree to which the system is meeting the information needs of all its users in an equal sense. In this work, we propose a probabilistic framework based on generalized cross entropy (GCE) to measure fairness of a given recommendation model. The framework comes with a suite of advantages: first, it allows the system designer to define and measure fairness for both users and items and can be applied to any classification task; second, it can incorporate various notions of fairness as it does not rely on specific and predefined probability distributions and they can be defined at design time; finally, in its design it uses a gain factor, which can be flexibly defined to contemplate different accuracy-related metrics to measure fairness upon decision-support metrics (e.g., precision, recall) or rank-based measures (e.g., NDCG, MAP). An experimental evaluation on four real-world datasets shows the nuances captured by our proposed metric regarding fairness on different user and item attributes, where nearest-neighbor recommenders tend to obtain good results under equality constraints. We observed that when the users are clustered based on both their interaction with the system and other sensitive attributes, such as age or gender, algorithms with similar performance values get different behaviors with respect to user fairness due to the different way they process data for each user cluster.},

Many clustering algorithms – such as k-means – rely on the euclidean distance as a similarity measure, which is often not the most relevant metric for high dimensional data such as images. Learning a lower-dimensional embedding that can better reﬂect the geometry of the dataset is therefore instrumental for performance. We propose a new approach for this task where the embedding is performed by a diﬀerentiable model such as a deep neural network. By rewriting the kmeans clustering algorithm as an optimal transport task, and adding an entropic regularization, we derive a fully diﬀerentiable loss function that can be minimized with respect to both the embedding parameters and the cluster parameters via stochastic gradient descent. We show that this new formulation generalizes a recently proposed state-of-theart method based on soft-k-means by adding constraints on the cluster sizes.

	abstract = {This paper considers an application of showing promotional widgets to web users on the homepage of a major professional social network site. The types of widgets include address book invitation, group join, friends’ skill endorsement and so forth. The objective is to optimize user engagement under certain business constraints. User actions on each widget may have very different downstream utilities, and quantiﬁcation of such utilities can sometimes be quite difﬁcult. Since there are multiple widgets to rank when a user visits, launching a personalized model to simply optimize user engagement such as clicks is often inappropriate. In this paper we propose a scalable constrained optimization framework to solve this problem. We consider several different types of constraints according to the business needs for this application. We show through both ofﬂine experiments and online A/B tests that our optimization framework can lead to signiﬁcant improvement in user engagement while satisfying the desired set of business objectives.},

This enables building a large and consistent dictionary on-the-ﬂy that facilitates contrastive unsupervised learning. MoCo provides competitive results under the common linear protocol on ImageNet classiﬁcation. More importantly, the representations learned by MoCo transfer well to downstream tasks. MoCo can outperform its supervised pre-training counterpart in 7 detection/segmentation tasks on PASCAL VOC, COCO, and other datasets, sometimes surpassing it by large margins.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Renal dialysis is a lifesaving but demanding therapy, requiring 3 weekly treatments of multiple-hour durations. Though travel times and quality of care vary across facilities, the extent to which patients are willing and able to engage in weighing tradeoffs is not known. Since 2015, Medicare has summarized and reported quality data for dialysis facilities using a star rating system. We estimate choice models to assess the relative roles of travel distance and quality of care in explaining patient choice of facility.
RESEARCH DESIGN: Using national data on 2 million patient-years from 7198 dialysis facilities and 4-star rating releases, we estimated travel distance to patients' closest facilities, incremental travel distance to the next closest facility with a higher star rating, and the difference in ratings between these 2 facilities. We fit mixed effects logistic regression models predicting whether patients dialyzed at their closest facilities.
RESULTS: Median travel distance was 4 times that in rural (10.9 miles) versus urban areas (2.6 miles). Higher differences in rating [odds ratios (OR): 0.56; 95\% confidence interval (CI): 0.50-0.62] and greater area deprivation (OR: 0.50; 95\% CI: 0.48-0.53) were associated with lower odds of attending one's closest facility. Stratified models were also fit based on urbanicity. For rural patients, excess travel was associated with higher odds of attending the closer facility (per 10 miles; OR: 1.05; 95\% CI: 1.04-1.06). Star rating differences were associated with lower odds of receiving care from the closest facility among urban (OR: 0.57; 95\% CI: 0.51-0.63) and rural patients (OR: 0.18; 95\% CI: 0.08-0.44).
CONCLUSIONS: Most dialysis patients have higher rated facilities located not much further than their closest facility, suggesting many patients could evaluate tradeoffs between distance and quality of care in where they receive dialysis. Our results show that such tradeoffs likely occur. Therefore, quality ratings such as the Dialysis Facility Compare (DFC) Star Rating may provide actionable information to patients and caregivers. However, we were not able to assess whether these associations reflect a causal effect of the Star Ratings on patient choice, as the Star Ratings served only as a marker of quality of care.},

	abstract = {The burden of travel from a patient's residence to health care providers is an important issue that can influence access to diagnosis and treatment of cancer. Although several studies have shown that the travel burden can result in delays in diagnosis and treatment of many common cancers, its role appears underestimated in the treatment of patients in clinical practice. Therefore, we performed a review of the published data on the role of travel burden influencing four items: delay of diagnosis, adequate treatment of cancer, outcome, and quality of life of cancer patients. Forty-seven studies published up to December 2014 were initially identified. Twenty studies were excluded because they did not regard specifically the four items of our review. Twenty-seven studies formed the basis of our study and involved 716,153 patients. The associations between travel burden and (a) cancer stage at diagnosis (12 studies), (b) appropriate treatment (8 studies), (c) outcome (4 studies), and (d) quality of life (1 study) are reported. In addition, in two studies, the relation between travel burden and compliance with treatment was examined. The results of our review show that increasing travel requirements are associated with more advanced disease at diagnosis, inappropriate treatment, a worse prognosis, and a worse quality of life. These results suggest that clinical oncologists should remember the specific travel burden problem for cancer patients, who often need health care services every week or every month for many years.},

A cohort study was conducted including cancer patients in Denmark diagnosed between 2005 and 2016 with rectum, malignant melanoma, breast, testis, oesophageal, colon, cervix, prostate, stomach, pancreatic, lung and ovary cancer (n = 256,663). Distance to each patient's GP and to the hospital of diagnosis were calculated using ArcGIS, Network Analyst. The results showed that for most easy-to-diagnose cancer types (rectum cancer, malignant melanoma, testis cancer) and cervix cancer, increasing travel distance to the hospital of diagnosis increased the odds of advanced disease at diagnosis. Contrary, increasing travel distance to the hospital was associated with decreased odds of being diagnosed with advanced disease stage among hard-to-diagnose cancer types (stomach, pancreatic, lung and ovarian cancer), and prostate cancer. Distance to the GP was overall not associated with tumour stage. The underlying mechanisms for these findings are multifaceted and might reflect differences in presentation, symptomologies and investigations used for diagnosis across cancer types.},

With centralization of cancer services, patients may have to travel considerable distances from their homes and families, to receive specialist cancer treatment. Centralization of cancer services may have advantages in terms of concentrating clinical expertise, enhancing the range of ancillary facilities and rationalising the provision of expensive specialist equipment, but it is not known to what extent patients are affected by additional travel and the prospect of separation from their social networks. A systematic literature search using MEDLINE, SSCI, SOCA and PSYCHLIT, identified 11 relevant studies from six countries. The review showed a paucity of research on the implications of receiving cancer treatment far from home. Most studies can be criticised on methodological grounds. The evidence that travel distance and difficulty increases psychological distress, and reduces compliance with treatment and take up of treatment is largely inconclusive. However, travel to cancer treatment is described as inconvenient and a practical hardship for many patients. It may be perceived, or experienced as, a barrier to treatment.

This study had a twofold aim: in accordance to the GP's suspicion of cancer, we investigated the association between: 1) cancer patient's travel distance to the first specialised diagnostic facility and the GP's diagnostic strategy and 2) cancer patient's travel distance to the first specialised diagnostic facility and satisfaction with the waiting time and the availability of diagnostic investigations.
METHOD: This combined questionnaire- and registry-based study included incident cancer patients diagnosed in the last 6 months of 2016 where the GP had been involved in the diagnostic process of the patients prior to their diagnosis of cancer (n = 3455). The patient's travel distance to the first specialised diagnostic facility was calculated by ArcGIS Network Analyst. The diagnostic strategy, cancer suspicion and the GP's satisfaction with the waiting times and the available investigations were assessed from GP questionnaires.
RESULTS: When the GP did not suspect cancer or serious illness, an insignificant tendency was seen that longer travel distance to the first specialised diagnostic facility increased the likelihood of the GP using 'wait-and-see' approach and 'medical treatment' as diagnostic strategies. The GPs of patients with travel distance longer than 49 km to the first specialised diagnostic facility were more likely to report dissatisfaction with the waiting time for requested diagnostic investigations (PR: 1.98, 95\% CI: 1.20-3.28).
CONCLUSION: A insignificant tendency to use 'wait-and-see' and 'medical treatment' were seen among GPs of patients with long travel distance to the first diagnostic facility when the GP did not suspect cancer or serious illness. Long distance was associated with higher probability of GP dissatisfaction with the waiting time for diagnostic investigations.},

METHOD: A nationwide cohort study was conducted based on data from both questionnaires and registries. Danish cancer patients diagnosed in 2005-2016 and their general practitioner (GP) were included if enrolled in the Danish Cancer in Primary Care (CaP) cohort (n = 37,872). The CaP cohorts provided data on intervals assessed by patients and GPs. The Geographical Information System (GIS) was used to calculate travel distances from the residence of the patient to their GP surgery and to the hospital of diagnosis.
RESULTS: Longer travel distance to the hospital of diagnosis was associated with longer diagnostic interval. This association was strongest in the period before the implementation of Cancer Patient Pathways (CPP) in 2010. Patients with a cancer categorised as ´hard to diagnose´ contributed mostly to the association. Longer travel distance to the GP was associated with shorter patient interval and primary care interval for patients diagnosed with cancer types ´intermediate to diagnose´.
CONCLUSION: Travel distance to cancer diagnostic health care services was associated with interval length in the diagnostic pathway. This association was less pronounced in the period after introducing CPPs and also strongly depending of the underlying cancer type and symptomatology.},

DESIGN: Systematic Review. We searched MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, Transport database, HMIC and EBM Reviews for studies up to 7 September 2016. Studies were excluded that included children (including maternity), emergency medical travel or countries classed as being in the global south.
SETTINGS: A wide range of settings within primary and secondary care (these were not restricted in the search).
RESULTS: 108 studies met the inclusion criteria. The results were mixed. 77\% of the included studies identified evidence of a distance decay association, whereby patients living further away from healthcare facilities they needed to attend had worse health outcomes (eg, survival rates, length of stay in hospital and non-attendance at follow-up) than those who lived closer. 6 of the studies identified the reverse (a distance bias effect) whereby patients living at a greater distance had better health outcomes. The remaining 19 studies found no relationship. There was a large variation in the data available to the studies on the patients' geographical locations and the healthcare facilities attended, and the methods used to calculate travel times and distances were not consistent across studies.
CONCLUSIONS: The review observed that a relationship between travelling further and having worse health outcomes cannot be ruled out and should be considered within the healthcare services location debate.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Rurality can contribute to the vulnerability of people with chronic diseases. Qualitative research can identify a wide range of health care access issues faced by patients living in a remote or rural setting.
OBJECTIVE: To systematically review and synthesize qualitative research on the advantages and disadvantages rural patients with chronic diseases face when accessing both rural and distant care.
DATA SOURCES: This report synthesizes 12 primary qualitative studies on the topic of access to health care for rural patients with chronic disease. Included studies were published between 2002 and 2012 and followed adult patients in North America, Europe, Australia, and New Zealand.
REVIEW METHODS: Qualitative meta-synthesis was used to integrate findings across primary research studies.
RESULTS: Three major themes were identified: geography, availability of health care professionals, and rural culture. First, geographic distance from services poses access barriers, worsened by transportation problems or weather conditions. Community supports and rurally located services can help overcome these challenges. Second, the limited availability of health care professionals (coupled with low education or lack of peer support) increases the feeling of vulnerability. When care is available locally, patients appreciate long-term relationships with individual clinicians and care personalized by familiarity with the patient as a person. Finally, patients may feel culturally marginalized in the urban health care context, especially if health literacy is low. A culture of self-reliance and community belonging in rural areas may incline patients to do without distant care and may mitigate feelings of vulnerability.
LIMITATIONS: Qualitative research findings are not intended to generalize directly to populations, although meta-synthesis across a number of qualitative studies builds an increasingly robust understanding that is more likely to be transferable. Selected studies focused on the vulnerability experiences of rural dwellers with chronic disease; findings emphasize the patient rather than the provider perspective.
CONCLUSIONS: This study corroborates previous knowledge and concerns about access issues in rural and remote areas, such as geographical distance and shortage of health care professionals and services. Unhealthy behaviours and reduced willingness to seek care increase patients' vulnerability. Patients' perspectives also highlight rural culture's potential to either exacerbate or mitigate access issues.
PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY: People who live in a rural area may feel more vulnerable--that is, more easily harmed by their health problems or experiences with the health care system. Qualitative research looks at these experiences from the patient's point of view. We found 3 broad concerns in the studies we looked at. The first was geography: needing to travel long distances for health care can make care hard to reach, especially if transportation is difficult or the weather is bad. The second concern was availability of health professionals: rural areas often lack health care services. Patients may also feel powerless in "referral games" between rural and urban providers. People with low education or without others to help them may find navigating care more difficult. When rural services are available, patients like seeing clinicians who have known them for a long time, and like how familiar clinicians treat them as a whole person. The third concern was rural culture: patients may feel like outsiders in city hospitals or clinics. As well, in rural communities, people may share a feeling of self-reliance and community belonging. This may make them more eager to take care of themselves and each other, and less willing to seek distant care. Each of these factors can increase or decrease patient vulnerability, depending on how health services are provided.},

	abstract = {Access to healthcare is a requirement for human well-being that is constrained, in part, by the allocation of healthcare resources relative to the geographically dispersed human population1–3. Quantifying access to care globally is challenging due to the absence of a comprehensive database of healthcare facilities. We harness major data collection efforts underway by OpenStreetMap, Google Maps and academic researchers to compile the most complete collection of facility locations to date. Leveraging the geographically variable strengths of our facility datasets, we use an established methodology4 to characterize travel time to healthcare facilities in unprecedented detail. We produce maps of travel time with and without access to motorized transport, thus characterizing travel time to healthcare for populations distributed across the wealth spectrum. We find that just 8.9\% of the global population (646 million people) cannot reach healthcare within one hour if they have access to motorized transport, and that 43.3\% (3.16 billion people) cannot reach a healthcare facility by foot within one hour. Our maps highlight an additional vulnerability faced by poorer individuals in remote areas and can help to estimate whether individuals will seek healthcare when it is needed, as well as providing an evidence base for efficiently distributing limited healthcare and transportation resources to underserved populations both now and in the future.},

	abstract = {Ensuring access to healthcare in emergency health situations is a persistent concern for health system planners. Emergency services, including critical care units for severe burns and coronary events, are amongst those for which travel time is the most crucial, potentially making a difference between life and death. Although it is generally assumed that access to healthcare is not an issue in densely populated urban areas due to short distances, we prove otherwise by applying improved methods of assessing accessibility to emergency services by the urban poor that take traffic variability into account. Combining unique data on emergency health service locations, traffic flow variability and informal settlements boundaries, we generated time-cost based service areas to assess the extent to which emergency health services are reachable by urban slum dwellers when realistic traffic conditions and their variability in time are considered. Variability in traffic congestion is found to have significant impact on the measurement of timely access to, and availability of, healthcare services for slum populations. While under moderate traffic conditions all slums in Dhaka City are within 60-minutes travel time from an emergency service, in congested traffic conditions only 63\% of the city’s slum population is within 60-minutes reach of most emergency services, and only 32\% are within 60-minutes reach of a Burn Unit. Moreover, under congested traffic conditions only 12\% of slums in Dhaka City Corporation comply with Bangladesh’s policy guidelines that call for access to 1 health service per 50,000 population for most emergency service types, and not a single slum achieved this target for Burn Units. Emergency Obstetric Care (EmOC) and First Aid \& Casualty services provide the best coverage, with nearly 100\% of the slum population having timely access within 60-minutes in any traffic condition. Ignoring variability in traffic conditions results in a 3-fold overestimation of geographic coverage and masks intra-urban inequities in accessibility to emergency care, by overestimating geographic accessibility in peripheral areas and underestimating the same for central city areas. The evidence provided can help policy makers and urban planners improve health service delivery for the urban poor. We recommend that taking traffic conditions be taken into account in future GIS-based analysis and planning for healthcare service accessibility in urban areas.},

	abstract = {Surveys, by their very nature, result in data structures that are multivariate. While recognizing the value of simple approaches to survey data analysis, the benefits of a more in- depth analysis, for selected population sub-groups through the application of multivariate techniques, are illustrated in this chapter. Software is now available which makes possible the application of these more advanced methods by survey researchers. This chapter demonstrates a range of situations where multivariate methods have a role to play in index construction and in initial stages of data exploration with specific subsets of the survey data, before further analysis is done to address specific survey objectives. The focus is mainly on methods that involve the simultaneous study of several key variables. In this context, multivariate methods allow a deeper exploration into possible patterns that exist in the data, enable complex inter-relationships between many variables to be represented graphically, and provide ways of reducing the dimensionality of the data for summary and further analysis. The discussion on index construction uses the broader interpretation of multivariate methods to include regression type methods. The emphasis throughout is on providing an overview of multivariate methods so that an appreciation of their value towards index construction can be obtained from a very practical point of view. It is aimed both at those engaged in large scale household surveys and at survey researchers involved in research and development projects who may have little experience in the application of the analysis approaches described here. The use of these methods is illustrated with suitable examples and a discussion of how the results may be interpreted.},

Several road-matching methods have been developed in the last three decades. The main issue related to this process is selecting the most appropriate method. This selection depends on the data and requires a pre-process (i.e., accuracy assessment). This paper presents a new matching method for roads composed of different patterns. The proposed method matches road lines incrementally (i.e., from the most similar matching to the least similar). In the experimental testing, three road networks in Istanbul, Turkey, which are composed of tree, cellular, and hybrid patterns, provided by the municipality (authority), OpenStreetMap (volunteered), TomTom (private), and Basarsoft (private) were used. The similarity scores were determined using Hausdorff distance, orientation, sinuosity, mean perpendicular distance, mean length of triangle edges, and modified degree of connectivity. While the first four stages determined certain matches with regards to the scores, the last stage determined them with a criterion for overlapping areas among the buffers of the candidates. The results were evaluated with manual matching. According to the precision, recall, and F-value, the proposed method gives satisfactory results on different types of road patterns.},

	abstract = {YD crashes occur on more sinuous roads than OD crashes, which confirms previous findings around road type and relates specifically to the section of road on which the crash occurred. Background Young drivers (YD) are at high risk of crashing because of their age and inexperience, leading some to ‘test’ themselves on roads that they perceive to be more challenging. While this may have applied more to male YD in the past, crash data indicate that whilst male YD crashes have decreased rapidly in recent years, female YD crashes have decreased much more slowly. Research suggests that female YD are beginning to show behaviours previously seen as ‘male’ and linked to crash risk. This paper aimed to examine the links between road crashes amongst male and female YD and older drivers (OD) and road sinuosity. Methods Police road crash data on single vehicle crashes were analysed for Wales for 2000–2013. Young drivers were aged 17–19 years and older drivers aged 30–59 years. Each crash was linked to the road network segment (length of road between two consecutive junctions) on which it occurred. Sinuosity of the segment was the ratio of the actual segment length to the straight line distance between start and end of the segment. Analysis was by year, for males and females and for night-time v day time. Results For 17–19 year male YD, 95th percentile sinuosity values ranged from 1.14 to 1.24, with no trends. For females aged 17–19, 95th percentile values ranged from 1.12 to 1.36 and showed a trend to increasing sinuosity of road crash segments. Amongst OD 95th percentile sinuosity values were lower (1.11–1.28 for males, 1.12–1.31 for females) and decreased over time. Conclusions YD crashes occur on more sinuous roads than OD crashes. This confirms previous findings around road type and relates specifically to the section of road on which the crash occurred. Realistically though, making the road network less sinuous is not a viable intervention; therefore addressing factors that place YD at higher risk on these roads is important. For YD, this means restricting alcohol consumption, passenger carriage and night-time driving, in short Graduated Driver Licensing.},

We aim to test the feasibility of creating data-driven indices by aggregating input variables according to principal component analysis (PCA) loadings. To validate the significance of both the theory-based and data-driven indices, we propose principles to review innovative indices. We generated weighted indices with the variables obtained in the first years of the two-year panels in the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey initiated between 1996 and 2011. Variables were weighted according to PCA loadings and summed. The statistical significance and residual deviance of each index to predict mortality in the second years was extracted from the results of discrete-time survival analyses. There were 237,832 surviving the first years of panels, represented 4.5 billion civilians in the United States, of which 0.62\% (95\% CI = 0.58\% to 0.66\%) died in the second years of the panels. Of all 134,689 weighted indices, there were 40,803 significantly predicting mortality in the second years with or without the adjustment of age, sex and races. The significant indices in the both models could at most lead to 10,200 years of academic tenure for individual researchers publishing four indices per year or 618.2 years of publishing for journals with annual volume of 66 articles. In conclusion, if aggregating information based on PCA loadings, there can be a large number of significant innovative indices composing input variables of various predictive powers. To justify the large quantities of innovative indices, we propose a reporting and review framework for novel indices based on the objectives to create indices, variable weighting, related outcomes and database characteristics. The indices selected by this framework could lead to a new genre of publications focusing on meaningful aggregation of information.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: As the world's largest coal producer, China was accounted for about 46\% of global coal production. Among present coal mining risks, methane gas (called gas in this paper) explosion or ignition in an underground mine remains ever-present. Although many techniques have been used, gas accidents associated with the complex elements of underground gassy mines need more robust monitoring or warning systems to identify risks. This paper aimed to determine which single method between the PCA and Entropy methods better establishes a responsive weighted indexing measurement to improve coal mining safety.
METHODS: Qualitative and quantitative mixed research methodologies were adopted for this research, including analysis of two case studies, correlation analysis, and comparative analysis. The literature reviewed the most-used multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) methods, including subjective methods and objective methods. The advantages and disadvantages of each MCDM method were briefly discussed. One more round literature review was conducted to search publications between 2017 and 2019 in CNKI. Followed two case studies, correlation analysis and comparative analysis were then conducted. Research ethics was approved by the Shanxi Coking Coal Group Research Committee.
RESULTS: The literature searched a total of 25,831publications and found that the PCA method was the predominant method adopted, and the Entropy method was the second most widely adopted method. Two weighting methods were compared using two case studies. For the comparative analysis of Case Study 1, the PCA method appeared to be more responsive than the Entropy. For Case Study 2, the Entropy method is more responsive than the PCA. As a result, both methods were adopted for different cases in the case study mine and finally deployed for user acceptance testing on 5 November 2020.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings and suggestions were provided as further scopes for further research. This research indicated that no single method could be adopted as the better option for establishing indexing measurement in all cases. The practical implication suggests that comparative analysis should always be conducted on each case and determine the appropriate weighting method to the relevant case. This research recommended that the PCA method was a dimension reduction technique that could be handy for identifying the critical variables or factors and effectively used in hazard, risk, and emergency assessment. The PCA method might also be well-applied for developing predicting and forecasting systems as it was sensitive to outliers. The Entropy method might be suitable for all the cases requiring the MCDM. There is also a need to conduct further research to probe the causal reasons why the PCA and Entropy methods were applied to each case and not the other way round. This research found that the Entropy method provides higher accuracy than the PCA method. This research also found that the Entropy method demonstrated to assess the weights of the higher dimension dataset was higher sensitivity than the lower dimensions. Finally, the comprehensive analysis indicates a need to explore a more responsive method for establishing a weighted indexing measurement for warning applications in hazard, risk, and emergency assessments.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The NHS has a target of cutting its carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by 80\% below 1990 levels by 2050. Travel comprises 17\% of the NHS carbon footprint. This carbon footprint represents the total CO2 emissions caused directly or indirectly by the NHS. Patient journeys have previously been planned largely without regard to the environmental impact. The potential contribution of 'avoidable' journeys in primary care is significant.
AIM: To investigate the carbon footprint of patients travelling to and from a general practice surgery, the issues involved, and potential solutions for reducing patient travel.
DESIGN AND SETTING: A mixed methods study in a medium-sized practice in Yorkshire.
METHOD: During March 2012, 306 patients completed a travel survey. GIS maps of patients' travel (modes and distances) were produced. Two focus groups (12 clinical and 13 non-clinical staff) were recorded, transcribed, and analysed using a thematic framework approach.
RESULTS: The majority (61\%) of patient journeys to and from the surgery were made by car or taxi; main reasons cited were 'convenience', 'time saving', and 'no alternative' for accessing the surgery. Using distances calculated via ArcGIS, the annual estimated CO2 equivalent carbon emissions for the practice totalled approximately 63 tonnes. Predominant themes from interviews related to issues with systems for booking appointments and repeat prescriptions; alternative travel modes; delivering health care; and solutions to reducing travel.
CONCLUSION: The modes and distances of patient travel can be accurately determined and allow appropriate carbon emission calculations for GP practices. Although challenging, there is scope for identifying potential solutions (for example, modifying administration systems and promoting walking) to reduce 'avoidable' journeys and cut carbon emissions while maintaining access to health care.},

This study aims to quantify the average carbon footprint of a primary care consultation, describe differences between primary care practices (best, worst and average performing) in western Switzerland and identify opportunities for mitigation.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective carbon footprint analysis of ten private practices over the year 2018. We used life-cycle analysis to estimate carbon emissions of each sector, from manufacture to disposal, expressing results as CO2 equivalents per average consultation and practice. We then modelled an average and theoretical best- case and worst-case practices. Collected data included invoices, medical and furniture inventories, heating and power supply, staff and patient transport, laboratory analyses (in/out-house) waste quantities and management costs.
RESULTS: An average medical consultation generated 4.8 kg of CO2eq and overall, an average practice produced 30 tons of CO2eq per year, with 45.7\% for staff and patient transport and 29.8\% for heating. Medical consumables produced 5.5\% of CO2eq emissions, while in-house laboratory and X-rays contributed less than 1\% each. Emergency analyses requiring courier transport caused 5.8\% of all emissions. Support activities generated 82.6\% of the total CO2eq. Simulation of best- and worst-case scenarios resulted in a ten-fold variation in CO2eq emissions.
CONCLUSION: Optimizing structural and organisational aspects of practice work could have a major impact on the carbon footprint of primary care practices without large-scale changes in medical activities.},

	abstract = {Quantifying the topological similarities of different parts of urban road networks enables us to understand urban growth patterns. Although conventional statistics provide useful information about the characteristics of either a single node’s direct neighbours or the entire network, such metrics fail to measure the similarities of subnetworks or capture local, indirect neighbourhood relationships. Here we propose a graph-based machine learning method to quantify the spatial homogeneity of subnetworks. We apply the method to 11,790 urban road networks across 30 cities worldwide to measure the spatial homogeneity of road networks within each city and across different cities. We find that intracity spatial homogeneity is highly associated with socioeconomic status indicators such as gross domestic product and population growth. Moreover, intercity spatial homogeneity values obtained by transferring the model across different cities reveal the intercity similarity of urban network structures originating in Europe, passed on to cities in the United States and Asia. The socioeconomic development and intercity similarity revealed using our method can be leveraged to understand and transfer insights between cities. It also enables us to address urban policy challenges including network planning in rapidly urbanizing areas and regional inequality.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Healthcare systems generate substantial carbon footprints that may be targeted to decrease greenhouse gas emissions. Outreach clinics may represent tools to assist in this reduction by optimizing patient related travel. Therefore, we sought to estimate the carbon footprint savings associated with a head and neck surgery outreach clinic.
METHODS: This study was a cross-sectional survey of patient travel patterns to a surgical outreach clinic compared to a regional cancer treatment centre from December 2019 to February 2020. Participants completed a self-administered survey of 12 items eliciting travel distance, vehicle details, and ability to combine medical appointments. Canadian datasets of manufacturer provided vehicular efficiency were used to estimate carbon emissions for each participant. Geographic information systems were used for analyses.
RESULTS: One hundred thirteen patients were included for analysis. The majority of patients (85.8\%) used their own personal vehicle to travel to the outreach clinic. The median distance to the clinic and regional centre were 29.0 km (IQR 6.0-51.9) and 327.0 km (IQR 309.0-337.0) respectively. The mean carbon emission reduction per person was therefore 117,495.4 g (SD: 29,040.0) to 143,570.9 g (SD: 40,236.0). This represents up to 2.5\% of an average individual's yearly carbon footprint. Fewer than 10\% of patients indicated they were able to carpool or group their appointments.
CONCLUSION: Surgical outreach clinics decrease carbon footprints associated with patient travel compared to continued care at a regional centre. Further research is needed to determine possible interventions to further reduce carbon emissions associated with the surgical care of patients.},

Global urbanization will continue at high speed; the world's urban population is projected to increase by more than 3 billion people between 2010 and 2050. Some of this increase will be the result of high urban fertility rates and reclassification of rural land into urban areas, but a significant portion of future urbanization will be caused by rural-to-urban migration. This migration is expected to be particularly prevalent in countries and regions most affected by the changing climate. While urban populations generally enjoy a higher quality of life, many cities in the developing world have large slums with populations that are largely excluded from access to resources, jobs, and public services. In the environmental security literature, great rural resource scarcity, causing rural to urban migration, is seen as an important source of violent conflict. This study investigates how population growth affects patterns of public unrest in urban centers within the context of crucial intervening factors like democracy, poverty, economic shocks. It utilizes a newly collected event dataset of urban social disturbance covering 55 major cities in Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa since 1960. The empirical analysis provides little support for the notion that high and increasing urban population pressure leads to a higher risk or frequency of social disorder. Instead, we find that urban disorder is primarily associated with a lack of consistent political institutions, economic shocks, and ongoing civil conflict.},

Major disruptions to food production, water supplies, and coastal livability are predicted unless significant action is taken to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Ironically, modern health care is a major contributor to pollution that adversely affects human health. It is estimated that the health sectors of the United States, Australia, England, and Canada emit a combined 748 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalents annually. If the health sectors of these countries were an independent nation, they would rank seventh in the world for GHG emissions.},

	abstract = {A cataract day surgery service for the population of central Norfolk, UK, was provided by the main ophthalmic department in a district general hospital and in an outreach clinic in a community hospital 40km distant. The outreach clinic aimed to extend the accessibility of this particular service in a rural area where many patients faced long journeys to the main hospital. Samples of 201 patients attending the main hospital for day cataract surgery and 198 patients attending the outreach clinic for the same procedure were identified. Patients were interviewed and given questionnaire forms to establish their general health before the operation, their arrangements to get to hospital and their satisfaction with the clinic and the care they had received. The sample of patients attending the outreach clinic was slightly older, less affluent and in slightly poorer general health than the patients attending the main hospital. The two samples were similar in terms of visual acuity after the operation, complication rates, satisfaction with the outcome of the operation and subsequent use of health services. The journey to hospital was quicker, more convenient and less costly for the outreach clinic patients than the main hospital patients. The net benefit to patients of the outreach clinic was estimated as £39,000 per annum. Satisfaction with administrative matters, facilities at the two clinics and the care received was high in both samples, but patients were significantly more satisfied with arrangements at the smaller outreach clinic. This evidence suggests that an outreach clinic in a small community hospital can provide cataract day surgery under local anaesthesia as effectively as a district centre, at a reduced social cost and with positive social benefits. Further study of heath service costs is vital, but political pressure to acknowledge patient preferences for more local services is growing.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Ambient air pollution is suspected to cause lung cancer. We aimed to assess the association between long-term exposure to ambient air pollution and lung cancer incidence in European populations.
METHODS: This prospective analysis of data obtained by the European Study of Cohorts for Air Pollution Effects used data from 17 cohort studies based in nine European countries. Baseline addresses were geocoded and we assessed air pollution by land-use regression models for particulate matter (PM) with diameter of less than 10 μm (PM10), less than 2·5 μm (PM2·5), and between 2·5 and 10 μm (PMcoarse), soot (PM2·5absorbance), nitrogen oxides, and two traffic indicators. We used Cox regression models with adjustment for potential confounders for cohort-specific analyses and random effects models for meta-analyses.
FINDINGS: The 312 944 cohort members contributed 4 013 131 person-years at risk. During follow-up (mean 12·8 years), 2095 incident lung cancer cases were diagnosed. The meta-analyses showed a statistically significant association between risk for lung cancer and PM10 (hazard ratio [HR] 1·22 [95\% CI 1·03-1·45] per 10 μg/m(3)). For PM2·5 the HR was 1·18 (0·96-1·46) per 5 μg/m(3). The same increments of PM10 and PM2·5 were associated with HRs for adenocarcinomas of the lung of 1·51 (1·10-2·08) and 1·55 (1·05-2·29), respectively. An increase in road traffic of 4000 vehicle-km per day within 100 m of the residence was associated with an HR for lung cancer of 1·09 (0·99-1·21). The results showed no association between lung cancer and nitrogen oxides concentration (HR 1·01 [0·95-1·07] per 20 μg/m(3)) or traffic intensity on the nearest street (HR 1·00 [0·97-1·04] per 5000 vehicles per day).
INTERPRETATION: Particulate matter air pollution contributes to lung cancer incidence in Europe.

Accumulating climate impacts are putting an increased burden on the service provision of already stressed health care systems in many regions of the world. At the same time, the Paris agreement requires rapid emission reductions in all sectors of the global economy to stay well below the 2 °C target. This study shows that in OECD countries, China, and India, health care on average accounts for 5\% of the national CO2 footprint making the sector comparable in importance to the food sector. Some countries have seen reduced CO2 emissions related to health care despite growing expenditures since 2000, mirroring their economy wide emission trends. The average per capita health carbon footprint across the country sample in 2014 was 0.6 tCO2, varying between 1.51 tCO2/cap in the US and 0.06 tCO2/cap in India. A statistical analysis shows that the carbon intensity of the domestic energy system, the energy intensity of the domestic economy, and health care expenditure together explain half of the variance in per capita health carbon footprints. Our results indicate that important leverage points exist inside and outside the health sector. We discuss our findings in the context of the existing literature on the potentials and challenges of reducing GHG emissions in the health and energy sector.},

We compared information seeking among cancer survivors to those with a family history of cancer and those with no history of cancer. We identified characteristics associated with greater information seeking among cancer survivors, key sources of cancer-related information, and changes in information source use over time. Data from five iterations of the Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS) spanning 2003 to 2013 were merged and analyzed. Frequencies, cross-tabulations, multivariate logistic regression, and multinomial regression analyses were conducted. All data were weighted to provide representative estimates of the adult US population. Cancer information seeking was reported most frequently by cancer survivors (69.8 \%). The percentage of cancer survivors who reported information seeking increased from 66.8 \% in 2003 to 80.8 \% in 2013. Cancer information seeking was independently associated with age, education, and income; seeking was less likely among older adults, those with less education, and those with lower incomes. Compared to respondents in 2003, those in 2005 (odds ratio (OR) = 0.40, 95 \% confidence interval (CI) = 0.24-0.65) and 2008 (OR = .43, 95 \% CI = 0.26-0.70) were about half as likely to use the Internet as the first source of cancer information compared to a healthcare provider. Despite overall increases in cancer information seeking and access to health information from a variety of sources, healthcare providers remain a key source of health information for cancer survivors.},

In service networks, such as health and emergency services, public safety, fire fighting and so on, the location of servers and allocation of demand nodes to them have a strong impact on the congestion at each server and as such, on the quality of service. The previous efforts in this area have concentrated on enhancing the reliability and quality of service with a probabilistic orientation. In this paper we utilize fuzzy theory to develop a queuing maximal covering location–allocation model which we call the fuzzy queuing maximal covering location–allocation model. We consider fuzzified queuing parameters as well as fuzzified constraints to develop a new mathematical model which we convert to a single objective integer programming model. Our model considers one type of service call, one type of server and includes one constraint on the quality of service in the form of a service time or a queue length constraint. A genetic algorithm is developed to solve and test the model using up to 50-node networks. We also propose extensions to our model.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Preventive health care programs can save lives and contribute to a better quality of life by diagnosing serious medical conditions early. The Preventive Health Care Facility Location (PHCFL) problem is to identify optimal locations for preventive health care facilities so as to maximize participation. When identifying locations for preventive health care facilities, we need to consider the characteristics of the preventive health care services. First, people should have more flexibility to select service locations. Second, each preventive health care facility needs to have a minimum number of clients in order to retain accreditation.
RESULTS: This paper presents a new methodology for solving the PHCFL problem. In order to capture the characteristics of preventive health care services, we define a new accessibility measurement that combines the two-step floating catchment area method, distance factor, and the Huff-based competitive model. We assume that the accessibility of preventive health care services is a major determinant for participation in the service. Based on the new accessibility measurement, the PHCFL problem is formalized as a bi-objective model based on efficiency and coverage. The bi-objective model is solved using the Interchange algorithm. In order to accelerate the solving process, we implement the Interchange algorithm by building two new data structures, which captures the spatial structure of the PHCFL problem. In addition, in order to measure the spatial barrier between clients and preventive health care facilities accurately and dynamically, this paper estimates travelling distance and travelling time by calling the Google Maps Application Programming Interface (API).

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: In a conventional P-median model, demanding points are likely assigned to the closest supplying facilities, but this method exhibits evident limitations in real cases.
METHODS: This paper proposed a modified P-median model in which exact and approximate strategies are used. The first strategy aims to enumerate all of the possible combinations of P facilities, and the second strategy adopts simulated annealing to allocate resources considering capacity constraint and spatial compactness constraint. These strategies allow us to choose optimal locations by applying visual analytics, which is rarely employed in location allocation planning.
RESULTS: This model is applied to a case study in Henan Province, China, where three optimal healthcare centers are selected from candidate cities. First, the weighting factor in spatial compactness constraint is visually evaluated to obtain a plausible spatial pattern. Second, three optimal healthcare centers, namely, Zhengzhou, Xinxiang, and Nanyang, are identified in a hybrid transportation network by performing visual analytics. Third, alternative healthcare centers are obtained in a road network and compared with the above solution to understand the impacts of transportation network types.
CONCLUSIONS: The optimal healthcare centers are visually detected by employing an improved P-median model, which considers both geographic accessibility and service quality. The optimal solutions are obtained in two transportation networks, which suggest high-speed railways and highways play a significant role respectively.},

Assessing physical access to primary health care is an important exercise for health care planners and policy makers. The development of geographic information system (GIS) technology has greatly improved this assessment process in industrialized countries where digital cartographic data are widely available. In developing countries particularly in mountain areas, however, detailed cartographic data, even in hardcopy form, are nonexistent, inaccurate or severely lacking. This paper uses GIS technology to assess physical access to primary health care in a remote and impoverished region of Andean Bolivia. In addition, it proposes an alternative model of health personnel distribution to maximize physical accessibility. Methods involved extensive fieldwork in the region, utilizing GPS (global positioning system) technology in the development of the GIS and gathering other pertinent health data for the study. Satellite imagery also contributed to the development of the GIS and in the modeling process. The results indicate significant variation in physical access to primary health care across the three study sites. More importantly, this paper highlights the use of GIS technology as a powerful tool in improving physical accessibility in mountain areas of developing countries.},

	abstract = {Preventive healthcare aims at reducing the likelihood and severity of potentially life-threatening illnesses by protection and early detection. The level of participation to preventive healthcare programs is a crucial factor in terms of their effectiveness and efficiency. This paper provides a methodology for designing a network of preventive healthcare facilities so as to maximize participation. The number of facilities to be established and the location of each facility are the main determinants of the configuration of a healthcare facility network. We use the total (travel, waiting and service) time required for receiving the preventive service as a proxy for accessibility of a healthcare facility, and assume that each client would seek the services of the facility with minimum expected total time. At each facility, which we model as an M/M/1 queue so as to capture the level of congestion, the expected number of participants from each population zone decreases with the expected total time. In order to ensure service quality, the facilities cannot be operated unless their level of activity exceeds a minimum workload requirement. The arising mathematical formulation is highly nonlinear, and hence we provide a heuristic solution framework for this problem. Four heuristics are compared in terms of accuracy and computational requirements. The most efficient heuristic is utilized in solving a real life problem that involves the breast cancer screening center network in Montreal. In the context of this case, we found out that centralizing the total system capacity at the locations preferred by clients is a more effective strategy than decentralization by the use of a larger number of smaller facilities. We also show that the proposed methodology can be used in making the investment trade-off between expanding the total system capacity and changing the behavior of potential clients toward preventive healthcare programs by advertisement and education.},

	abstract = {The increasing inequality in spatial accessibility to hospitals in developing countries has been attracting attention from researchers and politicians. The situation seems to be worse in growing megacities where more than 10 million people live and rapid urban sprawl has caused serious problems with the supply of health and public transport services. The recent global COVID-19 pandemic calls for particular attention to be afforded to the matter of equal access to basic medical facilities and services for people across different neighborhoods. Although some studies have already been undertaken into the subject of health-focused inequality in the cities of developing countries, the spatial inequity in hospital accessibility has rarely been discussed to date. In this paper, I aim to provide new evidence by considering Beijing as a case study. With the results of my analysis, I show that low-income neighborhoods have experienced lower levels of accessibility not only to high-tier hospitals (secondary and tertiary hospitals) but also to primary healthcare services (primary hospital and neighborhood clinics). The rate at which high-income neighborhoods access secondary and tertiary hospitals is approximately 4 times and 1.5 times as high as that of low-income neighborhoods. Low-income face nearly twice the travel time of those from high-income neighborhoods to reach the nearest primary hospital or neighborhood clinics. Suburban neighborhoods have less access to medical services than neighborhoods that are located in the central urban areas. It seems that the rapid urban sprawl has been worsening spatial inequality in the context of access to medical services in the growing megacity of Beijing. Equal access to healthcare services should be prioritized in future policy discussions, especially in relation to the urban growth management of megacities in developing countries in order to ensure that fair and inclusive urbanization processes are undertaken. Equal access to healthcare services would also be widely beneficial in the context of managing the COVID-19 pandemic.},

However, most location-allocation models emphasize efficiency such as minimal travel burden or maximal demand coverage while omitting the equality issue. This case study optimizes the emergency medical service (EMS) in Shanghai from a trade-off perspective by comparing two models. One is the 2-step optimization (2SO) model that uses the maximum covering location problem (MCLP) to site new facilities and then a quadratic programming (QP) method to optimize capacities, the other performs location selection and capacity optimization simultaneously through greedy optimization (GO). There are several findings from various simulation scenarios. First, the GO model is more effective in optimizing equality, but the 2SO model offers a more balanced approach by covering more people within the mandatory response time while improving access equality. Secondly, solutions of both models change as demands and travel costs vary over time and call for dynamic adjustment of resource allocation. Thirdly, it is important to coordinate EMS with other agencies to ensure reasonable road connectivity and make contingency plans in events such as floods, earthquakes and other natural disasters.},

Many of the individuals contributing to this area of the discipline are identified, demonstrating the breadth of academic institutions spanning the globe where spatial optimization is represented in the research and curriculum of geographers. The article provides a characterization of what a spatial optimization problem is, but also properties, relationships, and challenges behind this. The ultimate purpose of this article is to highlight the spatial optimization subspecialty within geography and in doing so, highlight the need for continued spatial model development and application in the discipline. Further, there is also a need for research focused on techniques to solve spatial optimization problems, particularly in the context of geographic information systems.},

For epidemiologists, and for the management and administration of health care settings, it is critical to understand the spatial dynamics of disease. Spatial epidemiology relies increasingly on new methodologies, such as clustering algorithms, visualization and space-time modelling, the domain of Geographic Information Science. Implementation of those techniques appears at an increasing pace in commercial Geographic Information Systems, alongside more traditional techniques that are already part of such systems.

In this paper we address the planning problem: how the resources can be redistributed to achieve the highest equality of accessibility to the service providers. In particular, a quadratic programming approach is used to minimize the variance of accessibility scores across demand locations by readjusting the amounts of service supplies. Two case studies—job access in Columbus, OH and primary healthcare access in Chicago, IL—are used to illustrate the method. The result suggests that in order to achieve better equality of accessibility, peripheral areas, in general, need additional supplies to compensate for their less-central locations, and some central city areas also need to add supplies to accommodate high demands by the high population density there.},

	abstract = {Although it is generally agreed that public primary education should be equally available to all, a spatial disparity of educational opportunity exists worldwide, for wealthy families can acquire residential locations with better access to the best schools. Random allocation of school places is considered to be an effective approach for breaking such spatial linkages. This study addresses the problem of achieving the optimal spatial equality of educational opportunity by re-assigning school places to demand nodes using a combined mechanism that introduces a random allocation into a proximity-based system. This study proposes the use of a probability distribution for a full description of educational opportunity. A new spatial allocation optimization model towards equal educational opportunity with the maximum school travel distance constraints and capacities constraints was developed to maximize the resemblance between the probability distributions across demand nodes (RES-based model). This model was applied to a case study of primary school allocation in the Shijingshan District of Beijing, China, and was resolved in a heuristic way. The solution was compared with those provided by a capacitated proximity-based model and a model also using the random mechanism but measuring educational opportunity by expectation values (VAR-based model). It was found that the introducing of random mechanism could significantly improve the spatial equality of educational opportunity with a significant loss of spatial efficiency. In addition, the solution provided by the RES-based model was quite different to that provided by the VAR-based model. An improvement in the resemblance of demand node probability distributions might lead to an increase in the variance of expectations. The resemblance approach proposed in this study may also be applied to the optimization of other random objectives.},

We compare residence-based hospital discharge rates for AHC, by age cohorts, in these cities and find that New York City has higher rates than Hong Kong and Greater London. Hong Kong has the lowest hospital discharge rates for AHC among the population 15-64, but its rates are nearly as high as those in New York City among the population 65 and over. Our findings suggest that in contrast to Greater London, older residents in Hong Kong and New York face significant barriers in accessing primary care.

It covers six themes with an emphasis on methodological issues. (1) Our health-related behavior varies across geographic settings, so should public health policy. (2) Facilities (supply) and patients (demand) in a health care market interact with each other across geopolitical borders, and measures of health care accessibility need to capture that. (3) Our health outcome is the result of joint effects of individual attributes and neighborhood characteristics, and an adequate definition of neighborhood is critical for assessing neighborhood effect. (4) Disease rates in areas of small population are unreliable, and one effective way to mitigate the problem is to construct a larger, internally-homogenous and comparable area unit. (5) Defining a scientific geographic unit for health care market is critical for researchers, practitioners, and policy makers to evaluate health care delivery, and GIS enables us to define the unit (e.g., primary care service areas, hospital service areas, and cancer service areas) automatically, efficiently and optimally. (6) Aside from various optimization objectives around "efficiency", it is as important to plan the location and allocation of health care resources toward maximum equality in health care access.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Improving maternal health is globally introduced as an important health priority. The purpose of this study is to identify the high priority areas which require more maternal health services in Kerman, Iran.
METHODS: This is a descriptive cross-sectional study, performed in 2015. The literatures were first explored in order to extract geographic indicators and sub indicators relevant to the maternal health. Data were collected by the use of a questionnaire designed on the basis of AHP (Analytic Hierarchy Process) method. The validity and reliability of the questionnaire were confirmed by three medical informatics experts and test-retest method, respectively. Data were analyzed by Expert Choice software in order to specify the weight and importance of each indicator. The information were then added to Geographic Information System (GIS) to analyze and create the related maps.
RESULTS: Women's access to hospitals plays an important role in identifying high priority areas which need maternal care and services. More than half of the mothers in Kerman have a moderate level of access to maternal care services. There is an association between facilities that are provided for pregnant women and the existence of healthcare centers. Moreover, there is a negative correlation between maternal death and the number of facilities provided for medical care and services for pregnant women.
CONCLUSIONS: The application of GIS provides us with the capability to identify high priority areas which need maternal care. According to current population policies in Iran and the probable increase in the fertility rate, it is wise to plan proper schedules to improve health care services for pregnant women in Kerman.},

The accessibility to healthcare is determined not only by geographic distances to service locations, but also includes travel time, available modes of transportation, and departure time. Having access to the latest and accurate information regarding the healthcare accessibility allows the municipal government to plan for improvements, including expansion of healthcare infrastructure, effective labor distribution, alternative healthcare options for the regions with low accessibilities, and redesigning the public transportation routes and schedules. This paper proposes a new method named, Seoul Enhanced 2-Step Floating Catchment Area (SE2SFCA), which is customized for the city of Seoul, where population density is higher and the average distance between healthcare-service locations tends to be shorter than the typical North American or European cities. The proposed method of SE2SFCA is found to be realistic and effective in determining the weak accessibility regions. It resolves the over-estimation issues of the past, arising from the assignment of high healthcare accessibility for the regions with large hospitals and high density of population and hospitals.},

	abstract = {A recent advancement in location-allocation modeling proposes a new objective of minimizing inequality of accessibility. Existing work considers the planning problem as either selecting new sites or adjusting facility capacities, separately. This paper develops a two-step hybrid approach to the problem by optimizing both locations and capacities of facilities towards equal accessibility. A genetic algorithm is first employed to find the best locations to site new facilities, and then a quadratic programming method is used to determine the best capacity of each facility within a pre-defined range. The sequence is consistent with many decision-making practices. Results of a series of experiments demonstrate that location optimization reduces inequality in accessibility more significantly than capacity optimization.

Data Sources The 2011 state inpatient database in Florida from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project. Study Design A network optimization method was used to redefine HSAs and HRRs by maximizing patient-to-hospital flows within each HSA/HRR while minimizing flows between them. We first constructed as many HSAs/HRRs as existing Dartmouth units in Florida, and then compared the two by various metrics. Next, we sought to derive the optimal numbers and configurations of HSAs/HRRs that best reflect the modularity of hospitalization patterns in Florida. Principal Findings The HSAs/HRRs by our method are favored over the Dartmouth units in balance of region size and market structure, shape, and most important, local hospitalization. Conclusions The new method is automated, scale-flexible, and effective in capturing the natural structure of the health care system. It has great potential for applications in delineating other health care service areas or in larger geographic regions.},

	abstract = {The general practitioner is the key element within most rural health care delivery systems, virtually controlling referal to higher levels of care as well as providing basic care. In consequence of the progressive urban-based centralization of health care facilities and specialized personnel encouraged by the desire to take advantage of economies of scale in supply, the role of the general practitioner within rural health care delivery has become increasingly crucial. However, the supply of general practitioners in rural areas has not kept pace with demands, and accessibility to physicians has become a pressing issue in many rural areas. Although ‘accessibility’ is not taken to be synonymous with physical or geographical accessibility, the dispersed settlement characteristic of most rural areas elevates the latter to a position of primary importance. Following a discussion of the merits of measures of accessibility based upon utilization versus measures based upon the relative location of population and physicians, a measure on potential physical accessibility is presented and applied to a Canadian data set. The results suggest that although considerable differences in potential accessibility exist between rural areas near and far from urban centres, the smaller catchment populations of most rural general practitioners may partly compensate for isolation from major, urban concentrations of physicians.},

	doi = {10.1186/s12913-021-07046-3},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Optimal healthcare access improves the health status and decreases health inequalities. Many studies demonstrated the importance of spatial access to healthcare facilities in health outcomes, particularly using the enhanced two-step floating catchment area (E2SFCA) method. The study objectives were to build a hospital facility access indicator at a fine geographic scale, and then to assess the impact of spatial accessibility to inpatient hospital and non-hospital care services on the length of hospital stay (LOS).
METHODS: Data concerning older adults (≥75 years) living in the Nord administrative region of France were used. Hospital spatial accessibility was computed with the E2SFCA method, and the LOS score was calculated from the French national hospital activity and patient discharge database. The relationship between LOS and spatial accessibility to inpatient hospital care and to three non-hospital care types (general practitioners, physiotherapists, and home-visiting nurses) was analyzed with linear regression models.
RESULTS: The mean number (standard deviation) of beds per 10,000 inhabitants was 19.0 (10.69) in Medical, Surgical and Obstetrics (MCO) facilities and 5.58 (2.19) in Postoperative and Rehabilitation Care (SSR) facilities, highlighting important variations within the region. Accessibility to hospital services was higher in large urban areas, despite the dense population and higher demand. In 2014, the mean LOS scores were 0.26 for MCO and 0.85 for SSR, but their geographical repartition was non-homogeneous. The linear regression analysis revealed a strong negative and significant association between LOS and non-hospital care accessibility.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to measure spatial accessibility to inpatient hospital care in France using the E2SFCA method, and to investigate the relationship between healthcare utilization (LOS score) and spatial accessibility to inpatient hospital care facilities and three types of non-hospital care services. Our findings might help to make decisions about deploying additional beds and to identify the best locations for non-hospital care services. They might also contribute to improve access, and to ensure the best coordination and sustainability of inpatient and outpatient services, in order to better cover the population's healthcare needs. International studies using multiple consensual indicators of healthcare outcomes and accessibility and sophisticated modeling methods are needed.},

	abstract = {Pharmacies that sell over-the-counter (OTC) syringes are a major source of sterile syringes for injection drug users in cities and states where such sales are legal. In these cities and states, however, black injectors are markedly less likely to acquire syringes from pharmacies than white injectors. The present analysis documents spatial and temporal trends in OTC pharmacy access in New York City health districts over time (2001-2006) and investigates whether these trends are related to district racial/ethnic composition and to local need for OTC pharmacies. For each year of the study period, we used kernel density estimation methods to characterize spatial access to OTC pharmacies within each health district. Higher values on this measure indicate better access to these pharmacies. "Need" was operationalized using two different measures: the number of newly diagnosed injection-related AIDS cases per 10,000 residents (averaged across 1999-2001), and the number of drug-related hospital discharges per 10,000 residents (averaged across 1999-2001). District sociodemographic characteristics were assessed using 2000 US decennial census data. We used hierarchical linear models (HLM) for descriptive and inferential analyses and investigated whether the relationship between need and temporal trajectories in the Expanded Syringe Access Demonstration Program access varied by district racial/ethnic composition, controlling for district poverty rates. HLM analyses indicate that the mean spatial access to OTC pharmacies across New York City health districts was 12.71 in 2001 and increased linearly by 1.32 units annually thereafter. Temporal trajectories in spatial access to OTC pharmacies depended on both need and racial/ethnic composition. Within high-need districts, OTC pharmacy access was twice as high in 2001 and increased three times faster annually, in districts with higher proportions of non-Hispanic white residents than in districts with low proportions of these residents. In low-need districts, "whiter" districts had substantially greater baseline access to OTC pharmacies than districts with low proportions of non-Hispanic white residents. Access remained stable thereafter in low-need districts, regardless of racial/ethnic composition. Conclusions were consistent across both measures of "need" and persisted after controlling for local poverty rates. In both high- and low-need districts, spatial access to OTC pharmacies was greater in "Whiter" districts in 2001; in high-need districts, access also increased more rapidly over time in "whiter" districts. Ensuring equitable spatial access to OTC pharmacies may reduce injection-related HIV transmission overall and reduce racial/ethnic disparities in HIV incidence among injectors.},

A combination of visual and analytic methods was used to investigate whether predominantly Black census block groups in New York City had poor access to retail stores important for health. After controlling for retail demand, median household income, population density, and subway ridership, percent Black was associated with longer travel distances to various retail industries. Our findings suggest that Black neighborhoods in New York City face retail redlining.

This question of resource allocation is central to public health policy; however, decisions related to resource allocation are sometimes made via informal or subjective approaches. We walk readers through a process of identifying needs across different neighborhoods in New York City (NYC) by examining community district-level health outcomes using data from published Community Health Profile reports released by the NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) in 2015. In NYC, community districts are represented by community boards that provide a forum for addressing the needs of the community, making them a useful geographic unit for examining health information and turning data into action. We examined prevalence estimates and 95\% confidence intervals of health indicators in each community district to identify significant disparities and calculated relative disparities in rates or prevalence to understand the relative magnitude of each disparity. Lastly, we demonstrate an application of this approach by identifying a cluster of neighborhoods with a high chance of being overlooked for public health interventions by conventional methods because of the relative number of disparities that exist in these neighborhoods. We present information on the disparity profile (number of disparities and relative disparity) for each neighborhood within the cluster and discuss potential public health implications. This approach can be applied to other jurisdictions to inform public health planning and resource allocation.},

	abstract = {For many years, average bed occupancy level has been the primary measure that has guided hospital bed capacity decisions at both policy and managerial levels. Even now, the common wisdom that there is an excess of beds nationally has been based on a federal target of 85\% occupancy that was developed about 25 years ago. This paper examines data from New York state and uses queueing analysis to estimate bed unavailability in intensive care units (ICUs) and obstetrics units. Using various patient delay standards, units that appear to have insufficient capacity are identified. The results indicate that as many as 40\% of all obstetrics units and 90\% of ICUs have insufficient capacity to provide an appropriate bed when needed. This contrasts sharply with what would be deduced using standard average occupancy targets. Furthermore, given the model's assumptions, these estimates are likely to be conservative. These findings illustrate that if service quality is deemed important, hospitals need to plan capacity based on standards that reflect the ability to place patients in appropriate beds in a timely fashion rather than on target occupancy levels. Doing so will require the collection and analysis of operational data-such as demands for and use of beds, and patient delays--which generally are not available.},

Our findings, coupled with current demographic and clinical practice trends, indicate that a large fraction of obstetrics units nationwide could likely reduce their bed capacity while assuring timely access to care, resulting in large savings in capital and staffing costs. Given emerging health care delivery and payment models that will likely decrease demand for other types of hospital beds, our study suggests that data-based methodologies should be used by hospitals and policy makers to identify opportunities for reducing excess bed capacity in other inpatient units as well.},

However, the application to large spatial databases rises the following requirements for clustering algorithms: minimal requirements of domain knowledge to determine the input parameters, discovery of clusters with arbitrary shape and good efficiency on large databases. The well-known clustering algorithms offer no solution to the combination of these requirements. In this paper, we present the new clustering algorithm DBSCAN relying on a density-based notion of clusters which is designed to discover clusters of arbitrary shape. DBSCAN requires only one input parameter and supports the user in determining an appropriate value for it. We performed an experimental evaluation of the effectiveness and efficiency of DBSCAN using synthetic data and real data of the SEQUOIA 2000 benchmark. The results of our experiments demonstrate that (1) DBSCAN is significantly more effective in discovering clusters of arbitrary shape than the well-known algorithm CLAR-ANS, and that (2) DBSCAN outperforms CLARANS by a factor of more than 100 in terms of efficiency.},

Yet their algorithmic complexity generally prevents their direct use on large scale datasets. Among the possible strategies to alleviate this issue, practitioners can rely on computing estimates of these distances over subsets of data, i.e. minibatches. While computationally appealing, we highlight in this paper some limits of this strategy, arguing it can lead to undesirable smoothing effects. As an alternative, we suggest that the same minibatch strategy coupled with unbalanced optimal transport can yield more robust behavior. We discuss the associated theoretical properties, such as unbiased estimators, existence of gradients and concentration bounds. Our experimental study shows that in challenging problems associated to domain adaptation, the use of unbalanced optimal transport leads to signiﬁcantly better results, competing with or surpassing recent baselines.},

Using data from the 1988 Part B Medicare Annual Data (BMAD) file, they find that there is substantial geographic variation across both States and urban and rural areas in border crossing to seek services. As might be expected, there is more border crossing among smaller geographic areas than among States. Predominantly rural areas tend to be major importers of services, but urban areas, on average, export services. Border crossing tends to be greater for high-technology services such as advanced imaging, cardiovascular surgery, and oncology procedures. These results suggest that expenditure-control policies applying to States or metropolitan areas should incorporate adjusters for patients' current geographic patterns of care.},

	abstract = {The objectives of this study include conducting an analysis of access to primary medical care in rural Colorado through simultaneous consideration of primary care physician-to-population and distance-to-nearest provider indices. Analyses examined the potential development and implications of excessively large, perhaps unmanageable patient caseloads that might result from every rural Coloradoan's exclusive use of the nearest generalist physician as a regular source of care. Using American Medical Association Physician Masterfile data for 1995 and coordinates for latitude and longitude from U.S. Census files (Census of Population and Housing, 1990), the authors calculated distance to the nearest primary care physician for residents of each of the 1,317 block groups in Colorado's 52 rural counties. Caseloads for each generalist physician were computed assuming the population used the nearest provider for care. Straight-line mileage to primary medical care was modest for rural Coloradoans--a median distance of 2.5 miles. Almost two-thirds (65 percent) of the population resided within 5 miles, and virtually all residents (99 percent) were within 30 miles of a generalist physician. However, had everyone traveled the shortest possible distance to care, demand for service from many of the 343 primary care doctors in rural regions of the state would have been overwhelming. The results of simultaneous application of distance-to-care and provider-to-population techniques unrestricted by geographic boundaries depict access to primary medical care and corresponding consumer difficulty more fully than in previous studies. Further combination of methods of needs assessment such as those used in this analysis may better inform the future efforts of organizations mandated to address health care underservice in rural areas.},

Overall, this literature is not characterized by a particular attention to the importance of method in drawing conclusions about spatial equity based on empirical studies. Specifically, there has been scant interest in the effect of geographic methodology on assessing the relationship between access and socioeconomic characteristics that are spatially defined. In this paper we take a spatial analytical perspective to evaluate the importance of methodology in assessing whether or not, or to what degree the distribution of urban public services is equitable. We approach this issue by means of an empirical case study of the spatial distribution of playgrounds in Tulsa, Oklahoma, relative to that of the targeted constituencies (children) and other socioeconomic indicators. In addition to the 'traditional' measure (count of facilities in an areal unit), we consider a potential measure (based on the gravity model), average travel distance, and distance to the nearest playground as indicators of accessibility. We find significant differences between the spatial patterns in these measures that are suggested by local indicators of spatial association and other techniques of exploratory spatial data analysis. The choice of access measure not only implies a particular treatment of spatial externalities but also affects conclusions about the existence of spatial mismatch and inequity.},

	abstract = {Debates around access to and ownership of an individual's digital information have taken center stage in health care. A decade ago, the idea of offering patients ready access to their clinical notes was a fringe idea. Today, information transparency in health care is a pressing legislative and regulatory issue in the United States and elsewhere. The 21st Century Cures Act of 2016 requires that clinicians and health care organizations give patients electronic access to the information in their electronic medical records. Rules to enact this legislative priority by the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services substantially expanded the types of information that must be easily accessible to patients and exchanged among clinicians in electronic form. A growing body of research supports the notion that sharing transparent medical records, including clinical notes with patients, can help to strengthen communication, trust in clinicians, and patient engagement. Patients receiving dialysis may receive particular benefits from this greater transparency due to their increased risk for fragmented care. In the paper, we review the decade of research focused on the effects of sharing clinical notes with patients and the implications for improved engagement and care.},

This study sought to present the experiences of immigrant parents when they access health services for their children focusing specifically on the various sources of information that they used to improve their children's health.
DESIGN AND METHOD: This qualitative study was carried out in Edmonton, Alberta between April to October 2018. Fifty parents, chosen using purposive sampling participated in one-on-one semi-structured interviews. Interviews were recorded digitally, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed thematically.
RESULTS: We developed three main themes from the data: Accessing social networks for informational support, the role of professionals in accessing health care information, and navigating and evaluating information sources. The study demonstrates that immigrant families consulted various sources of information in order to meet their children's healthcare needs. The most common source was the Internet followed by friends and family members, and health care professionals.
DISCUSSION: Findings suggest that health information that is disseminated using the Internet needs to be made available in multiple languages to facilitate communication to persons who are not fluent in English nor French. Also, policy makers and health care professionals must increase focus on informal sources of health care information.},

Therefore, the society recently organised a workshop to define such recommendations. Thirteen experts from the different disciplines met for two days to discuss the topic. This international and multidisciplinary panel thoroughly reviewed the literature in order to prepare evidence-based recommendations. During the meeting, two working groups were set up to discuss in detail diagnosis and loco-regional and systemic treatments, including both group aspects of psychology and sexuality. The conclusions reached by the working groups were then discussed in a plenary session to reach panel consensus. Whenever possible, a measure of the level of evidence (LoE) from 1 (the highest) to 4 (the lowest) degree, based on the methodology proposed by the US Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), was assigned to each recommendation.

Towards the end of 2014, EUSOMA decided to update the paper on QIs to consider and incorporate new scientific knowledge in the field. Several new QIs have been included to address the need for improved follow-up care of patients following primary treatments. With regard to the management of elderly patients, considering the complexity, the expert group decided that, for some specific quality indicators, if centres fail to meet the minimum standard, older patients will be excluded from analysis, provided that reasons for non-adherence to the QI are specified in the clinical chart and are identified at the review of the clinical records. In this way, high standards are promoted, but centres are able to identify and account for the effect of non-standard treatment in the elderly. In the paper, there is no QI for outcome measurements, such as relapse rate or overall survival. However, it is hoped that this will be developed in time as the databases mature and user experience increases. All breast centres are required to record outcome data as accurately and comprehensively as possible to allow this to occur. In the paper, different initiatives undertaken at international and national level to audit quality of care through a set of QIs have been mentioned.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To assess pathways and associated costs of seeking care from the onset of symptoms to diagnosis in patients with confirmed and presumptive tuberculosis (TB).
DESIGN: Cross-sectional study.
SETTING: District hospital in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.
PARTICIPANTS: Bacteriologically confirmed TB and presumptive TB patients.
PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: We calculated distance in metres and visualised pathways to healthcare up to five visits for the current episode of sickness. Costs were described by medians and IQRs, with comparisons by gender and poverty status.
RESULTS: Of 100 confirmed and 100 presumptive TB patients, 44\% of confirmed patients sought care first at pharmacies after the onset of symptoms, and 42\% of presumptive patients did so at hospitals. The median visits made by confirmed patients was 2 (range 1-5) and 2 (range 1-3) by presumptive patients. Patients spent a median of 31\% of their monthly household income on health expenditures for all visits. The median total direct costs were higher in confirmed compared with presumptive patients (USD 27.4 [IQR 18.7-48.4] vs USD 19.8 [IQR 13.8-34.0], p=0.02), as were the indirect costs (USD 66.9 [IQR 35.5-150.0] vs USD 46.8 [IQR 20.1-115.3], p{\textless}0.001). The indirect costs were higher in men compared with women (USD 64.6 [IQR 31.8-159.1] vs USD 55.6 [IQR 25.1-141.1], p{\textless}0.001). The median total distance from patients' household to healthcare facilities for patients with confirmed and presumptive TB was 2338 m (IQR 1373-4122) and 2009 m (IQR 986-2976) respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with confirmed TB have complex pathways and higher costs of care compared with patients with presumptive TB, but the costs of the latter are also substantial. Improving access to healthcare and ensuring integration of different healthcare providers including private, public health practitioners and patients themselves could help in reducing the complex pathways during healthcare seeking and optimal healthcare utilisation.},

The Google Maps for Business Application Programming Interface (API) was used to develop an internal web application that uses real-time traffic data to determine estimated travel time (ETT; minutes) and estimated travel distance (ETD; miles) from a patient's home to each a nearby IR facility in our hospital system. Hypothetical patient home addresses based on the 33 cities comprising our institution's catchment area were used to determine the optimal IR site for hypothetical patients traveling from each city based on real-time traffic conditions. For 10/33 (30\%) cities, there was discordance between the optimal IR site based on ETT and the optimal IR site based on ETD at non-rush hour time or rush hour time. By choosing to travel to an IR site based on ETT rather than ETD, patients from discordant cities were predicted to save an average of 7.29 min during non-rush hour (p = 0.03), and 28.80 min during rush hour (p {\textless} 0.001). Using a custom Google Maps application to schedule outpatients for IR procedures can effectively reduce patient travel time when more than one location providing IR procedures is available within the same hospital system.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: We sought to systematically review the literature on ethnic differences in the likelihood of general practitioner (GP) involvement, police involvement, and involuntary admission on the pathway to care of patients with first-episode psychosis (FEP).
METHOD: We searched electronic databases and conducted forward and backward tracking to identify relevant studies. We calculated pooled odds ratios (OR) to examine the variation between aggregated ethnic groups in the indicators of the pathway to care.
RESULTS: We identified seven studies from Canada and England that looked at ethnic differences in GP involvement (n=7), police involvement (n=7), or involuntary admission (n=5). Aggregated ethnic groups were most often compared. The pooled ORs suggest that Black patients have a decreased likelihood of GP involvement (OR=0.70, 0.57-0.86) and an increased likelihood of police involvement (OR=2.11, 1.67-2.66), relative to White patients. The pooled ORs were not statistically significant for patients with Asian backgrounds (GP involvement OR=1.23, 0.87-1.75; police involvement OR=0.86, 0.57-1.30). There is also evidence to suggest that there may be ethnic differences in the likelihood of involuntary admission; however, effect modification by several sociodemographic factors precluded a pooling of these data.
CONCLUSION: Ethnic differences in pathways to care are present at the first episode of psychosis.},

	abstract = {AIMS: Gender is a critical demographic determinant in first-episode psychosis research. We used data from the ACE Pathways to Care Project, which examined pathways to care in African-origin, Caribbean-origin and European-origin participants, to investigate the role of gender in pathways to early intervention programmes.
METHOD: A qualitative approach was used to examine gender differences in the routes to care. We conducted four focus groups and four individual in-depth interviews with 25 service users of early intervention services from African-origin, Caribbean-origin and European-origin populations.
RESULTS: Gender stereotypes negatively influence the first service contact for women, and the early phase of the help seeking process for men. Women reported trying to seek care. However, family members and service providers often questioned their calls for help. Men described having difficulties in talking about their symptoms, as the act of seeking help was perceived as a sign of weakness by peers.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study suggest that gender stereotypes shape the journey to specialized care in different ways for men and women. Awareness of the impact that gender stereotypes have when a young person is seeking care for psychosis could help to promote a shift in attitudes among health-care providers and the provision of more compassionate and patient-centred care during this critical time.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Women with ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) have higher mortality rates than men. We investigated whether sex-related differences in timely access to care among STEMI patients may be a factor associated with excess risk of early mortality in women.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We identified 6022 STEMI patients who had information on time of symptom onset to time of hospital presentation at 41 hospitals participating in the ISACS-TC (International Survey of Acute Coronary Syndromes in Transitional Countries) registry (NCT01218776) from October 2010 through April 2016. Patients were stratified into time-delay cohorts. We estimated the 30-day risk of all-cause mortality in each cohort. Despite similar delays in seeking care, the overall time from symptom onset to hospital presentation was longer for women than men (median: 270 minutes [range: 130-776] versus 240 minutes [range: 120-600]). After adjustment for baseline variables, female sex was independently associated with greater risk of 30-day mortality (odds ratio: 1.58; 95\% confidence interval, 1.27-1.97). Sex differences in mortality following STEMI were no longer observed for patients having delays from symptom onset to hospital presentation of ≤1 hour (odds ratio: 0.77; 95\% confidence interval, 0.29-2.02).
CONCLUSIONS: Sex difference in mortality following STEMI persists and appears to be driven by prehospital delays in hospital presentation. Women appear to be more vulnerable to prolonged untreated ischemia.

	doi = {10.1002/cncr.30029},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Women with advanced bladder cancer have inferior survival compared with men. However, women treated on clinical trials do not appear to have a survival disadvantage. Less frequent administration of systemic chemotherapy in women with advanced bladder cancer may contribute to their inferior survival.
METHODS: The authors identified patients diagnosed with stage IV bladder cancer from 1998 through 2010 using the National Cancer Data Base, a national outcomes database that includes 70\% of all newly diagnosed cancer cases in the United States. Sex differences in demographics, systemic chemotherapy administration, and overall survival (OS) were compared.
RESULTS: A total of 23,981 patients were identified (35\% of whom were female). Compared with men, women were older, more likely to be black, and less likely to be insured (P{\textless}.01 for all). The Charlson-Deyo comorbidity score did not differ between men and women. Women were less likely to receive systemic chemotherapy than men (45\% vs 52\%; adjusted relative risk, 0.91 [95\% confidence interval (95\% CI), 0.88-0.94]). Women had a lower median OS compared with men (8.0 months [95\% CI, 7.7-8.3 months] vs 9.8 months [95\% CI, 9.5-10.0 months]; P{\textless}.001). OS remained lower for women on multivariable analysis, even after adjusting for the administration of systemic chemotherapy (hazard ratio for death, 1.11 [95\% CI, 1.08-1.15]).
CONCLUSIONS: Women are less likely than men to receive systemic chemotherapy for advanced bladder cancer and this difference may partially account for the poorer OS observed in women. However, OS remains lower in women independent of chemotherapy use, and may be related to unmeasured comorbidities, functional status, or tumor biology.

	abstract = {Patient reported health-related quality of life (QOL) is a major component of the overall well-being of cancer patients, with links to prognosis. In 6,420 lung cancer patients, we identified patient characteristics and genetic determinants of QOL. Patient responses from the SF-12 questionnaire was used to calculate normalized Physical Component Summary (PCS) and Mental Component Summary (MCS) scores. Further, we analyzed 218 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the p38 MAPK signaling pathway, a key mediator of response to cellular and environmental stress, as genetic determinants of QOL in a subset of the study population (N = 641). Trends among demographic factors for mean PCS and MCS included smoking status (PCS Ptrend {\textless} 0.001, MCS Ptrend {\textless} 0.001) and education (PCS Ptrend {\textless} 0.001, MCS Ptrend {\textless} 0.001). Similar relationships were seen for MCS. The homozygous rare genotype of MEF2B: rs2040562 showed an increased risk of a poor MCS (OR: 3.06, 95\% CI: 1.05-8.92, P = 0.041). Finally, survival analysis showed that a low PCS or a MCS was associated with increased risks of five-year mortality (HR = 1.63, 95\% CI: 1.51-1.77, HR = 1.23, 95\% CI: 1.16-1.32, respectively) and there was a significant reduction in median survival time (Plog-rank {\textless} 0.001). These findings suggest that multiple factors contribute to QOL in lung cancer patients, and baseline QOL can impact survival.},

Little has been published to characterize the information needs and preferred sources of that information for patients who have completed cancer treatment.

All patients who came to the designated clinics between December 2011 and June 2012 were approached (N = 648), and information was collected only from those who agreed to proceed. (3) Results: The 411 patients who completed the instrument included individuals with a wide range of primary malignancies. Their doctor or health professional was overwhelmingly the most trusted source of cancer information, followed by the Internet, family, and friends. The least trusted sources of information included radio, newspaper, and television. Patients most preferred to receive personalized written information from their health care provider. (4) Conclusions: Cancer survivors are keenly interested in receiving information about cancer, despite having undergone or finished active therapy. The data indicate that, for patients, their health care provider is the most trusted source of cancer information. Cancer providers should ask patients about the information they want and should direct them to trusted sources.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE/OBJECTIVES: To describe the experiences of cancer survivors and caregivers with healthcare providers in the context of the Internet as a source of health information.
RESEARCH APPROACH: Qualitative description.
SETTING: Online cancer communities hosted by the Association of Cancer Online Resources.
PARTICIPANTS: Purposive sample of 488 cancer survivors, with varying cancer types and survivorship stages, and caregivers.
METHODOLOGIC APPROACH: Secondary data analysis using Krippendorff's thematic clustering technique of qualitative content analysis.
MAIN RESEARCH VARIABLES: Survivorship, healthcare relationships, and the Internet.
FINDINGS: Disenchantment with healthcare relationships was associated with failed expectations related to evidence-based practice, clinical expertise, informational support, and therapeutic interpersonal communication. Survivors and caregivers exercised power in healthcare relationships through collaboration, direct confrontation, becoming expert, and endorsement to influence and control care decisions.
CONCLUSIONS: Disenchantment propelled cancer survivors and caregivers to search the Internet for health information and resources. Conversely, Internet information-seeking precipitated the experience of disenchantment. Through online health information and resources, concealed failures in healthcare relationships were revealed and cancer survivors and caregivers were empowered to influence and control care decisions.
INTERPRETATION: The findings highlight failures in cancer survivorship care and underscore the importance of novel interdisciplinary programs and models of care that support evidence-informed decision making, self-management, and improved quality of life. Healthcare professionals need to receive education on survivors' use of the Internet as a source of health information and its impact on healthcare relationships. Future research should include studies examining the relationship between disenchantment and survivorship outcomes.},

High-volume surgeons demonstrate reduced perioperative complications, shorter operative times, and reduced blood loss during multiple modalities of benign gynecologic surgery. Furthermore, high-volume surgeons consistently demonstrate higher rates of minimally invasive approaches, low rates of conversion to laparotomy, and lower per-procedure case costs. It is suggested that surgeons who have completed postresidency training have improved surgical outcomes, although these data are limited. Surgical exposure in obstetrics and gynecology residency is varied and does not consistently meet demonstrated surgical learning curves. Deficiencies in residency surgical training may be related to the volume-outcome relationship. We suggest reforming residency surgical training and tracking postresidency practice to provide optimal surgical care. Additionally, surgeons may have an ethical obligation to inform patients of their surgical volume and outcomes, with options for referrals if needed.},

MATERIALS OF STUDY: We evaluated the impact of the experience of 4 surgeons on the 5 years survival rate of patients with colon and rectal cancer and we valued if the surgeons' experience plays an equal role in both.
RESULTS: Four experienced surgeons operated 384 patients with colorectal cancer. Surgeon with the major experience and colorectal-dedicated presented a slightly better total 5 years survival rate, comparing to other surgeons, although he had a considerably better 5 years survival rate in rectal operations.
CONCLUSIONS: We concluded that surgeon- and hospital-related factors directly influence the surgeon learning curve and are therefore rightly considered predictors of outcome in colorectal cancer surgery. A low surgeon or hospital caseload may be compensated by intensified supervision or by improved training and teaching.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Past studies have identified surgeon- and institution- related characteristics as prognostic factors in colorectal cancer surgery. The present work assesses the influence of the surgeon's and the hospital's caseload on long-term results of colorectal cancer surgery.
METHODS: The data on 2706 patients from 2, randomized, colorectal cancer trials (Swiss Group for Clinical Cancer Research [SAKK] 40/81, SAKK 40/87) investigating adjuvant intraportal and systemic chemotherapy and 1 concurrent registration study (SAKK 40/88) were reviewed. A first analysis included 1809 eligible, nonmetastatic patients from all 3 studies. A subsequent subgroup analysis included 915 eligible patients from both randomized trials. Overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), and local recurrence (LR) were analyzed in multivariate models taking into account the possible effect of clustering. The main potential covariates were surgeon's annual caseload ({\textgreater}5 operations/year vs {\textless} or =5 operations/year), hospital's annual caseload ({\textgreater}26 operations/year vs {\textless} or =26 operations/year), tumor site, T stage, and nodal status.
RESULTS: Primary analysis of all 3 studies combined found a high surgeon's caseload to be positively associated with OS (P = .025) and marginally with DFS (P = .058). Separate analysis for each trial, however, showed that a high surgeon's caseload was beneficial for outcome in both randomized trials but not in the registration study. A subgroup analysis of 915 patients with 376 rectal and 539 colonic primaries from both randomized trials, therefore, was performed. Neither age, gender, year of operation, adjuvant chemotherapy (intraportal vs systemic vs operation alone), hospital academic status (university vs non-university), training status of the surgeon (certified surgeon vs surgeon-in-training), nor inclusion in 1 of the 2 randomized trials (SAKK 40/81 vs SAKK 40/87) was a significant predictor of outcome. However, both high surgeon's and high hospital's annual caseloads were independent, beneficial prognostic factors for OS (P = .0003, P = .044) and DFS (P = .0008, P = .020), and marginally significant factors for LR (P = .057, P = .055).
CONCLUSIONS: High surgeon's and hospital's annual caseloads are strong, independent prognostic factors for extending overall and disease-free survival and reducing the rate of local recurrence in 2 randomized colorectal cancer trials.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to determine the effect of surgeon specialty on disease-free survival and local control in patients with adenocarcinoma of the rectum. Patients underwent curative treatment with neoadjuvant external beam radiotherapy and proctectomy by colorectal surgeons and noncolorectal surgeons.
METHODS: The records of 384 consecutive patients treated by colorectal surgeons (n = 251) and noncolorectal surgeons (n = 133) from 1977 to 1995 were reviewed independently by physicians in the Division of Radiation Oncology. Local recurrence was defined as pelvic recurrence occurring in the presence or absence of distant metastatic disease.
RESULTS: The study population comprised 213 males, mean age 64 (range, 19-97) years. Preoperative radiotherapy was delivered as 4,500 cGy in 25 fractions six to eight weeks before surgery (n = 293) or 2,000 cGy in 5 fractions immediately before surgery (n = 91). Concurrent preoperative chemotherapy was given to 14 patients, postoperative chemotherapy to 55. Overall actuarial disease-free survival and local control rates were 74 and 90 percent, respectively, at five years. Actuarial disease-free survival and local control rates at five years were 77 and 93 percent for colorectal surgeons vs. 68 and 84 percent for noncolorectal surgeons (P {\textless} or = 0.005 for both, Tarone-Ware). Multivariate analysis revealed that pathologic stage and background of the surgeon were the only independent predictors of disease-free survival (both P {\textless} or = 0.006, Cox proportional hazards) and that pathologic stage, background of the surgeon, and proximal location of the tumor were independent predictors of local control (all P {\textless} or = 0.02, Cox proportional hazards). Radiation dose and use of chemotherapy were not significant factors. Sphincter preservation was more common by colorectal surgeons (131/251, 52 percent) than noncolorectal surgeons (40/133, 30 percent; P = 0.00004, Fisher's exact test, two-tailed).

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To determine whether surgeon case volume and Unit case volume affected specific recognized key performance indicators (KPIs) of breast cancer surgical management.
BACKGROUND: An increasing body of evidence suggests that a higher standard of cancer care, demonstrated by improved outcomes, is provided in high-volume units or by high-volume surgeons. The volume-outcome relationship pertaining to screen-detected breast cancers has yet to be thoroughly established and remains a pertinent issue in view of the debate surrounding breast cancer screening.
METHODS: The study population comprised all women with a new screen diagnosed breast cancer between 2004-2005 and 2009-2010. Surgeons' mean annual patient volumes were calculated and grouped as very low ({\textless}5), low (5-15), medium (16-49), or high volume ({\textgreater}50). The effect of breast screening unit volume was also evaluated. Statistical analyses were performed using Minitab V16.0 software (State College, PA) and R V2.13.0.
RESULTS: There were 81,416 patients aged 61 (±6.8) years treated by 682 surgeons across 82 units. There were 209 very low-, 126 low-, 295 medium-, and 51 high-volume surgeons. The proportion of patients managed by very low-, low-, medium-, and high-volume surgeons was 1.2\%, 6.9\%, 65.5\%, and 25.7\%, respectively. Patients managed by high-volume surgeons were more likely to have breast-conserving surgery (BCS) than those managed by low-volume surgeons (P {\textless} 0.001). There was a higher proportion of sentinel lymph node biopsies (SLNB) performed by high-volume surgeons in invasive cancers (P = 0.005). High-volume units performed more BCS and SLNB than low-volume units (P {\textless} 0.001 and P {\textless} 0.001, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: Even in a setting with established quality control measures (KPIs) surgeon and unit volume have potent influences on initial patient management and treatment.},

	abstract = {IMPORTANCE: Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is the standard of care for axillary staging in patients with clinically node-negative breast cancer. It is not known whether SLNB rates differ by surgeon expertise. If surgeons with less breast cancer expertise are less likely to offer SLNB to these patients, this practice pattern could lead to unnecessary axillary lymph node dissections and lymphedema.
OBJECTIVE: To explore potential measures of surgical expertise (including a novel objective specialization measure: percentage of a surgeon's operations performed for breast cancer determined from Medicare claims) on the use of SLNB for invasive breast cancer.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND POPULATION: A population-based prospective cohort study was conducted in California, Florida, and Illinois. Participants included elderly (65-89 years) women identified from Medicare claims as having had incident invasive breast cancer surgery in 2003. Patient, tumor, treatment, and surgeon characteristics were examined.
MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURE: Type of axillary surgery performed.
RESULTS: Of 1703 women who received treatment by 863 surgeons, 56.4\% underwent an initial SLNB, 37.2\% initial axillary lymph node dissection, and 6.3\% no axillary surgery. The median annual surgeon Medicare volume of breast cancer cases was 6.0 (range, 1.5-57.0); the median surgeon percentage of breast cancer cases was 4.5\% (range, 0.4\%-100.0\%). After multivariable adjustment of patient and surgeon factors, women operated on by surgeons with higher volumes and percentages of breast cancer cases had a higher likelihood of undergoing SLNB. Specifically, women were most likely to undergo SLNB if the operation was performed by high-volume surgeons (regardless of percentage) or by lower-volume surgeons with a high percentage of breast cancer cases. In addition, membership in the American Society of Breast Surgeons (odds ratio, 1.98; 95\% CI, 1.51-2.60) and Society of Surgical Oncology (1.59; 1.09-2.30) were independent predictors of women undergoing an initial SLNB.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Patients who receive treatment from surgeons with more experience with and focus on breast cancer are significantly more likely to undergo SLNB, highlighting the importance of receiving initial treatment by specialized providers. Factors relating to specialization in a particular area, including our novel surgeon percentage measure, require further investigation as potential indicators of quality of care.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Quality indicators (QIs) for breast cancer care have been developed and applied in high-income countries and contributed to improved quality of care and patient outcomes over time.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A modified Delphi process was used to derive expert consensus. Potential QIs were rated by a panel of 17 breast cancer experts from various subspecialties and across South African provinces. Each QI was rated according to importance to measure, scientific acceptability and feasibility. Scoring ranged from 1 (no agreement) to 5 (strong agreement). Inclusion thresholds were set a priori at mean ratings ≥4 with a coefficient variation of ≥25\%. Levels of evidence were determined for each indicator.
RESULTS: The literature review identified 790 potential QIs. After categorisation and removal of duplicates, 52 remained for panel review. There was strong consensus for 47 which were merged to 30 QIs by exclusion of similar indicators and indicator grouping. The final set included eight QIs with level I or II evidence and two QIs with level III evidence which were deemed "mandatory" due to clinical priority and impact on care. The remaining QIs with lower-level evidence were grouped as eight "recommended" QIs (regarded as standard of care) and twelve "optional" QIs (not regarded as standard of care).
CONCLUSION: A regional set of QIs was developed to facilitate standardised treatment and auditing of surgical care for breast cancer patients in South Africa. Routine monitoring of the ten mandatory QIs, which were selected to have the most substantial impact on patient outcome, is proposed.},

This study explored the stability and possible predictors of such preferences over time.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Cancer patients seeing two Medical Oncologists in an out-patient clinic at an Australian teaching hospital completed a questionnaire battery before and directly after one consultation, and before their next consultation. Eighty consecutive patients with heterogeneous cancers participated in the study. Preferences for general and specific information, involvement and support were elicited at each assessment. Locus of control and patient familiarity with the clinic were measured before the first consultation. Patient satisfaction with the consultation was assessed directly after the consultation. Demographic and disease data were recorded for each patient.
RESULTS: General preferences for information and involvement were relatively stable, at least in the short term; however there was considerable variability in preferences for specific topics of information. Patients whose condition had recently worsened were more likely to want progressively less involvement in decision-making. Gender, the doctor seen and religion were also predictive of patient preferences.
CONCLUSIONS: Situational factors, such as change in disease status, may alter a patient's preferences for information and involvement. If we wish to match the provision of information and support to the expressed needs of patients, we must ask patients at each consultation what those needs are.},

A pilot study evaluated the impact of giving patients a choice of receiving an audiotape of their primary treatment consultation. The participants in the multicentered, randomized, controlled study were 36 patients with breast or prostate cancer. Measures of decisional role preference, anxiety, satisfaction, recall of information, and perceptions of oncologists' likability and expertise were administered before and after the consultation and six weeks later. At follow-up, recall of information was significantly greater among patients who chose to receive the audiotape. Furthermore, the patients who, at follow-up, recalled the most information had the highest degree of satisfaction with patient-physician communication. The results suggested that the intervention is a practical, effective, and inexpensive means of enhancing patient-physician communication, facilitating recall of information, and fostering patient satisfaction.},

A comprehensive package, NPIP, consisting of procedural information regarding cancer centre location, description of the health care team, treatment services, research, educational activities, accommodation and community services provided at the centre; and a condensed version of the same package, mini-NPIP, were developed. Consecutive patients with newly diagnosed breast, gynaecological, lung and prostate cancer, referred to the centre for the first time were prerandomised to receive NPIP, mini-NPIP or no information package. Patients randomised to NPIP or mini-NPIP were mailed the information package at least one week before their first appointment. On arrival at the centre, patients were administered the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI) which measures psychological distress, and interviewed regarding preferences for information and acceptability of the information packages. Of 465 randomised patients, 161 were excluded post-randomisation and 304 completed the entire interview: 100 were randomised to the NPIP, 102 to the mini-NPIP and 102 to the control group. Emotional distress as measured by the BSI was similar for all groups (P = 0.98). Most patients preferred to receive the information (98\%), receive it before the first appointment (84\%) and by mail (79\%). These preferences were more evident for those given the information packages. The majority of patients found the information packages easy to understand (88\%) and useful (89\%), and no differences were detected between packages. The cost of production and dissemination of NPIP was more than double the cost for mini-NPIP: \$ 8.93 vs \$ 3.98 (Canadian dollars) per patient. For patients presenting to a cancer centre for the first time, packages of procedural information do not appear to reduce psychological distress, but are preferred by patients. Given the cost of producing NPIP, mini-NPIP is the preferred approach.},

In an attempt to address these needs, a variety of methods have been used to facilitate the passage of information from health professionals and other cancer information sources to cancer patients and their families. These include written material, telephone help-lines, teaching and audiovisual aids. Although these efforts have been well received, little attention has been given to the effectiveness of the methods employed. The aims of this paper were to systematically review randomized controlled trials that have evaluated methods of information-giving to cancer patients and their families. Relevant literature was identified through computerized databases, Internet cancer sites and bibliography searches. Multiple reviewers independently analysed the methodological quality of the papers according to agreed criteria. From this process, 10 studies were identified. Interventions ranged from written information to audiotapes, audiovisual aids and interactive medium. Individually tailored methods such as patient care records and patient educational programmes were also reviewed. The evidence indicated that the interventions had positive effects on a number of patient outcomes, such as knowledge and recall, symptom management, satisfaction, preferences, health care utilization and affective states. This was above and beyond the usual care provision. In the majority of studies the interventions had no effect on psychological indices. Furthermore, the review highlighted that certain methods should be based on individual preferences for information rather than uniformly administered.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cancer survivors represent a growing population, heterogeneous in their need for medical care, psychosocial support, and practical assistance. To inform survivorship research and practice, this manuscript will describe the prevalent population of cancer survivors in terms of overall numbers and prevalence by cancer site and time since diagnosis.
METHODS: Incidence and survival data from 1975-2007 were obtained from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program and population projections from the United States Census Bureau. Cancer prevalence for 2012 and beyond was estimated using the Prevalence Incidence Approach Model, assuming constant future incidence and survival trends but dynamic projections of the U.S. population.
RESULTS: As of January 1, 2012, approximately 13.7 million cancer survivors were living in the United States with prevalence projected to approach 18 million by 2022. Sixty-four percent of this population have survived 5 years or more; 40\% have survived 10 years or more; and 15\% have survived 20 years or more after diagnosis. Over the next decade, the number of people who have lived 5 years or more after their cancer diagnosis is projected to increase approximately 37\% to 11.9 million.
CONCLUSIONS: A coordinated agenda for research and practice is needed to address cancer survivors' long-term medical, psychosocial, and practical needs across the survivorship trajectory.
IMPACT: Prevalence estimates for cancer survivors across the survivorship trajectory will inform the national research agenda as well as future projections about the health service needs of this population.},

In this study, the authors determined the total number of information sources obtained and used to influence treatment decisions, and the clinical and demographic factors associated with the use of specific sources of information in cancer patients. Participants were identified by the statewide cancer registry and diagnosed in 2004 with breast, colorectal, lung, or prostate cancer. A self-administered mailed questionnaire elicited cancer treatments, demographics, and information sources used to make treatment decisions. Of those surveyed, 1,784 (66\%) participated and responded to all questions regarding information use. Over 69\% of study participants reported obtaining information from a source other than the treatment staff. Significant predictors of using additional information sources included younger age, higher income, higher education, complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) use, and reporting shared decision making (all p values {\textless}.01). Participants with a college degree were more likely to use the Internet (OR 3.7; 95\% CI 1.5-9.0) and scientific research reports (OR 3.3; 95\% CI 1.6-6.9) to influence treatment decisions compared with those without a high school degree. Support group use to influence treatment decisions was not associated with socioeconomic variables but did vary by cancer type and CAM use. The sources of information study participants obtained and used to influence treatment decisions varied strongly by socioeconomic and demographic variables. These findings provide a deeper understanding of the information needs of cancer patients and have implications for dissemination strategies that can minimize disparities in access to cancer information.},

	abstract = {Survivors' information-seeking behavior has traditionally been documented through analysis of inquiries to hotlines and cancer information services. Data from these self-selected inquiries tend to be restricted to a time around diagnosis, and to those populations possessing the wherewithal and motivation to seek information actively. The current study used data from a general population survey to assess 1) the prevalence of information-seeking behavior among survivors in the general population, 2) characteristics of seekers versus nonseekers, 3) ratings of information-seeking experience, and 4) actual versus preferred sources of information. Data were analyzed from the 2005 administration of the Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS). HINTS is a cross-sectional, random digit dial telephone survey, weighted to provide estimates for the general population. Nearly half of all Americans (48.7\%) indicated that they have looked for cancer information from 1 source or another. Percentages were highest for those who have been touched by cancer (63.1\% of cancer survivors and 54.6\% of those with family histories) and lowest for those with no cancer history (27.6\% of those with no history). Quality concerns topped the list of information-seeking experiences for those recalling the last time they looked. Patterns of information-seeking revealed a discrepancy between preferred and actual source when tracked over years since diagnosis. Information-seeking is prevalent among cancer survivors and does not diminish over time. Prescriptions are given for reengineering the information environment to improve long-term outcomes for survivors.},

RESULTS: The CS group reported greater consumption of cancer-related information, but the CS and NCC groups did not differ in information source use or preferences. The CS group was more confident of their ability to get cancer information, reported more trust in health care professionals and television as cancer information sources, but evaluated their recent cancer information-seeking experiences more negatively than the NCC group. Awareness of cancer information resources was surprisingly low in both the CS and NCC groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Cancer diagnosis and treatment subtly alters cancer information-seeking preferences and experience. However, awareness and use of cancer information resources was relatively low regardless of personal history of cancer.},

The objective of this study was to provide nationally representative estimates for health-related uses of the Internet, level of trust in health information sources, and preferences for cancer information sources.
METHODS: Data from the Health Information National Trends Survey were used. A total of 6369 persons 18 years or older were studied. The main outcome measures were online health activities, levels of trust, and source preference.
RESULTS: Analyses indicated that 63.0\% (95\% confidence interval [CI], 61.7\%-64.3\%) of the US adult population in 2003 reported ever going online, with 63.7\% (95\% CI, 61.7\%-65.8\%) of the online population having looked for health information for themselves or others at least once in the previous 12 months. Despite newly available communication channels, physicians remained the most highly trusted information source to patients, with 62.4\% (95\% CI, 60.8\%-64.0\%) of adults expressing a lot of trust in their physicians. When asked where they preferred going for specific health information, 49.5\% (95\% CI, 48.1\%-50.8\%) reported wanting to go to their physicians first. When asked where they actually went, 48.6\% (95\% CI, 46.1\%-51.0\%) reported going online first, with only 10.9\% (95\% CI, 9.5\%-12.3\%) going to their physicians first.
CONCLUSION: The Health Information National Trends Survey data portray a tectonic shift in the ways in which patients consume health and medical information, with more patients looking for information online before talking with their physicians.},

	abstract = {Background: Consumer health information technology (IT) solutions are designed to support patient health management and have the ability to facilitate patients’ health information communication with their social networks. However, there is a need for consumer health IT solutions to align with patients’ health management preferences for increased adoption of the technology. It may be possible to gain an understanding of patients’ needs for consumer health IT supporting their health information communication with social networks by explicating how they have adopted and adapted social networking sites, such as Facebook, for this purpose. Objective: Our aim was to characterize patients’ use of all communication mechanisms within Facebook for health information communication to provide insight into how consumer health IT solutions may be better designed to meet patients’ communication needs and preferences. Methods: This study analyzed data about Facebook communication mechanisms use from a larger, three-phase, sequential, mixed-methods study. We report here on the results of the study’s first phase: qualitative interviews (N=25). Participants were over 18, used Facebook, were residents or citizens of the United States, spoke English, and had a diagnosis consistent with type 2 diabetes. Participants were recruited through Facebook groups and pages. Participant interviews were conducted via Skype or telephone between July and September 2014. Data analysis was grounded in qualitative content analysis and the initial coding framework was informed by the findings of a previous study. Results: Participants’ rationales for the use or disuse of a particular Facebook mechanism to communicate health information reflected six broad themes: (1) characteristics and circumstances of the person, (2) characteristics and circumstances of the relationship, (3) structure and composition of the social network, (4) content of the information, (5) communication purpose, and (6) attributes of the technology. Conclusions: The results of this study showed that participants consider multiple factors when choosing a Facebook mechanism for health information communication. Factors included what information they intended to share, what they were trying to accomplish, attributes of technology, and attributes and communication practices of their social networks. There is a need for consumer health IT that allows for a range of choices to suit the intersectionality of participants’ rationales. Technology that better meets patients’ needs may lead to better self-management of health conditions, and therefore, improve overall health outcomes.},

The purpose of this study is to investigate how the use of cancer-related health communications is patterned by race, ethnicity, language, and social class.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In a nationally-representative cross-sectional telephone survey, 5,187 U.S. adults provided information about demographic characteristics, cancer information seeking, and attention to and trust in health information from television, radio, newspaper, magazines, and the Internet. Cancer information seeking was lowest among Spanish-speaking Hispanics (odds ratio: 0.42; 95\% confidence interval: 0.28-0.63) compared to non-Hispanic whites. Spanish-speaking Hispanics were more likely than non-Hispanic whites to pay attention to (odds ratio: 3.10; 95\% confidence interval: 2.07-4.66) and trust (odds ratio: 2.61; 95\% confidence interval: 1.53-4.47) health messages from the radio. Non-Hispanic blacks were more likely than non-Hispanic whites to pay attention to (odds ratio: 2.39; 95\% confidence interval: 1.88-3.04) and trust (odds ratio: 2.16; 95\% confidence interval: 1.61-2.90) health messages on television. Those who were college graduates tended to pay more attention to health information from newspapers (odds ratio: 1.98; 95\% confidence interval: 1.42-2.75), magazines (odds ratio: 1.86; 95\% confidence interval: 1.32-2.60), and the Internet (odds ratio: 4.74; 95\% confidence interval: 2.70-8.31) and had less trust in cancer-related health information from television (odds ratio: 0.44; 95\% confidence interval: 0.32-0.62) and radio (odds ratio: 0.54; 95\% confidence interval: 0.34-0.86) compared to those who were not high school graduates.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Health media use is patterned by race, ethnicity, language and social class. Providing greater access to and enhancing the quality of health media by taking into account factors associated with social determinants may contribute to addressing social disparities in health.},

	shorttitle = {Effective physician-patient communication and health outcomes},
	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To ascertain whether the quality of physician-patient communication makes a significant difference to patient health outcomes.
DATA SOURCES: The MEDLINE database was searched for articles published from 1983 to 1993 using "physician-patient relations" as the primary medical subject heading. Several bibliographies and conference proceedings were also reviewed.
STUDY SELECTION: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and analytic studies of physician-patient communication in which patient health was an outcome variable.
DATA EXTRACTION: The following information was recorded about each study: sample size, patient characteristics, clinical setting, elements of communication assessed, patient outcomes measured, and direction and significance of any association found between aspects of communication and patient outcomes.
DATA SYNTHESIS: Of the 21 studies that met the final criteria for review, 16 reported positive results, 4 reported negative (i.e., nonsignificant) results, and 1 was inconclusive. The quality of communication both in the history-taking segment of the visit and during discussion of the management plan was found to influence patient health outcomes. The outcomes affected were, in descending order of frequency, emotional health, symptom resolution, function, physiologic measures (i.e., blood pressure and blood sugar level) and pain control.
CONCLUSIONS: Most of the studies reviewed demonstrated a correlation between effective physician-patient communication and improved patient health outcomes. The components of effective communication identified by these studies can be used as the basis both for curriculum development in medical education and for patient education programs. Future research should focus on evaluating such educational programs.},

DESIGN: Prospective study of patients and families by questionnaire interviews in the patients' homes.
SETTING: Inner London and north Kent (London suburbs).
SUBJECTS: 65 Patients, each with a member of their family or a career.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Ratings of eight current problems and ratings and comments on three services-hospital doctors and nurses, general practitioners and district nurses, and the support team staff-obtained after a minimum of two weeks' care from palliative care support teams.
RESULTS: Effect of anxiety on the patient's nearest career. and symptom control were rated as the most severe current problems by both patients and families; a few patients and families identified other severe problems. Families' ratings of pain control, symptom control, and effect of anxiety on the patient were significantly worse than the patients' ratings (p less than 0.05). Support teams received the most praise, being rated by 58 (89\%) patients and 59 (91\%) of family members as good as excellent. General practitioners and district nurses were rated good or excellent by 46 (71\%) patients and 46 (71\%) family members, but six (9\%) in each group rated the service as poor or very bad, and ratings in the inner London district were significantly worse than those in the outer London district. Hospital doctors and nurses were rated good or excellent by 22 (34\%) patients and 35 (54\%) of family members, and 14 (22\%) patients and 15 (23\%) family members rated this service as poor or very bad. Negative comments referred to communication (especially at diagnosis), coordination of services, the attitude of the doctor, delays in diagnosis, and difficulties in getting doctors to visit at home. Family members were more satisfied with the services than were patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Palliative care needs to include both the patient and family because the needs of the family may exceed those of the patient. Support teams and some hospital and community doctors and nurses met the perceived needs of dying patients and families, but better education and organisation of services are needed.},

PATIENTS AND METHODS: During a 2-week period, 191 ambulatory patients participated in the survey. Questionnaires were also mailed to Canadian oncologists: 410 of 686 questionnaires were returned (response rate = 60\%).
RESULTS: Of the 191 patients, 86\% wanted as much information as possible about their illness, 54\% reported receiving insufficient information, 83\% cited physicians as their primary information source, and 7\% cited the Internet. Seventy-one percent of patients actively searched for information, and 50\% used the Internet. Patients' opinions about the balance, accuracy, and relevance of news media reports were evenly split. English as the first language, access to the Internet, and use of alternative treatments predicted a higher rate of information seeking. Most oncologists routinely pay some attention to medical news and believe that it is difficult for patients to interpret medical information in the media and on the Internet accurately. Both patients and oncologists agree that information seeking does not affect the patient-physician relationship.
CONCLUSION: Information searching is common among cancer patients in Canada. It does not affect the patient-doctor relationship. The media and the Internet are powerful means of medical information dissemination. Strategic efforts are needed to improve the quality of medical news reporting by the media, and to provide guidance for patients to understand their disease and interpret such information better.},

A survey was administered to breast cancer patients and their families attending follow-up outpatient clinics in a comprehensive cancer care center to explore their frequency of Internet use, their motivation for online activity, the type of information they sought, and the perceived impact of the information they found on the Internet on their medical care. The survey was conducted over a 4-month period. A total of 107 surveys were returned. Seventy-nine of these (74\%) were from patients while 28 (26\%) were from family members and friends. Thirty-four of the patient responses (43\%) indicated that the patient had used the Internet to look for cancer-related information. Patients who had used the Internet to access cancer-related information were significantly younger (P = 0.007), better educated (P = 0.027), and less satisfied with the amount of treatment-related information given by caregivers than those patients who had not used the Internet to access cancer-related information (P = 0.032). The majority of patient Internet users desired more information on their cancer and its treatment (91\%), looked up information that was presented to them by their clinicians (66\%), researched other treatment options (63\%), and obtained more information on "alternative treatments" (63\%). Patient Internet users generally found the cancer-related information on the Internet to be useful, and the majority discussed Internet-derived information with their health care providers and perceived that clinicians listened to such information. However, 53\% were undecided about the trustworthiness of the medical information obtained via the Internet. Internet nonusers commonly lacked Internet access (53\%) or were unfamiliar with the Internet (33\%), but few (13\%) distrusted Internet-derived information. This exploratory study underscores the need for more research in this area, specifically with the aims of identifying and verifying factors that lead patients to use the Internet and the impact of their online activities on their medical care.},

DESIGN: Qualitative study using semistructured interviews collected by maximum variation sampling.
SETTING: Respondents recruited throughout the United Kingdom during 2001-2.
PARTICIPANTS: 175 men and women aged 19-83 years, with one of five cancers (prostate, testicular, breast, cervical, or bowel) diagnosed since 1992 and selected to include different stages of treatment and follow up.
RESULTS: Internet use, either directly or via friend or family, was widespread and reported by patients at all stages of cancer care, from early investigations to follow up after treatment. Patients used the internet to find second opinions, seek support and experiential information from other patients, interpret symptoms, seek information about tests and treatments, help interpret consultations, identify questions for doctors, make anonymous private inquiries, and raise awareness of the cancer. Patients also used it to check their doctors' advice covertly and to develop an expertise in their cancer. This expertise, reflecting familiarity with computer technology and medical terms, enabled patients to present a new type of "social fitness."
CONCLUSION: Cancer patients used the internet for a wide range of information and support needs, many of which are unlikely to be met through conventional health care. Serious illness often undermines people's self image as a competent member of society. Cancer patients may use the internet to acquire expertise to display competence in the face of serious illness.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Delays in diagnosis and treatment from first noticeable breast cancer symptoms are associated with poor outcomes. Understanding the reasons and barriers for patients' delay in seeking medical care is critical to mitigating the problem.
METHODS: In-person surveys were conducted among 462 women, aged 18-79, with incident breast cancer cases, recruited from two cancer hospitals in North Vietnam. Delay, defined as the time interval between symptom recognition to the diagnosis and initiation of treatment equal to or exceeding 3 months, was categorized as follows: no delay ({\textless}3 months), moderate delay (3-8 months), and serious delay (≥9 months). Multivariable multinomial logistic regression was applied in data analyses.
RESULTS: Over one-quarter patients (31.5\%) experienced moderate delays, and close to one-fifth (17.5\%) experienced serious delays. Adjusted odds ratios and 95\% confidence intervals for moderate and serious delays were 5.60 (3.00-10.47) and 4.25 (2.05-8.85) for financial and physical barriers, respectively. Moderate delay was positively associated with psychological barriers (5.55 [1.75-17.57]) and lack of proper knowledge (3.15 [1.47-6.74]). The associations of barriers with delays in diagnosis and treatment appeared stronger among women living in rural areas. A lack of proper knowledge was significantly associated with delay among young women ({\textless}45 years old) and those with high incomes, while psychological barriers were significantly associated with delay among older women (≥45 years old).
CONCLUSION: Delays in diagnosis and treatment are common among Vietnamese breast cancer patients and are affected by several noted barriers. Proper policy needs to be developed to address this public health issue.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Most breast cancer patients in low- and middle-income settings are diagnosed at advanced stages due to lengthy intervals of care. This study aimed to understand the mechanisms through which delays occur in the patient interval and diagnosis interval of care.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional survey including 886 patients referred to four major public cancer hospitals in Mexico City. Based in a conceptual model of help-seeking behavior, a path analysis strategy was used to identify the relationships between explanatory factors of patient delay and diagnosis delay.
RESULTS: The patient and the diagnosis intervals were greater than 3 months in 20\% and 65\% of participants, respectively. We present explanatory models for each interval and the interrelationship between the associated factors. The patient interval was longer among women who were single, interpreted their symptoms as not worrisome, concealed symptoms, and perceived a lack of financial resources and the difficulty of missing a day of work as barriers to seek care. These barriers were more commonly perceived among patients who were younger, had lower socioeconomic status, and lived outside of Mexico City. The diagnosis interval was longer among those who used several different health services prior to the cancer hospital and perceived medical errors in these services. More health services were used among those who perceived errors and long waiting times for appointments, and who first consulted private services.
CONCLUSION: Our findings support the relevance of strengthening early cancer diagnosis strategies, especially the improvement of quality of primary care and expedited referral routes to cancer services.
IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: This study's findings suggest that policy in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) should be directed toward reducing delays in diagnosis, before the implementation of mammography screening programs. The results suggest several factors susceptible to early diagnosis interventions. To reduce patient delays, the usually proposed intervention of awareness promotion could better work in LMIC contexts if the message goes beyond the advertising of screening mammography to encourage the recognition of potential cancer symptoms and sharing of symptoms with significant others. To reduce diagnosis delay, efforts should focus on strengthening the quality of public primary care services and improving referral routes to cancer care centers.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Breast cancer patients in Malaysia often present late, delaying diagnosis and treatment. Decisions on health-seeking behaviour are influenced by a complex interplay of several factors. Early detection and subsequent successful treatment are the main goal in order to reduce breast cancer mortality. The aims of this study were to identify the time taken by women with breast cancer for consultation, diagnosis and first definitive treatment and the factors associated with the initiation of definitive treatment.
METHODS: In this cohort study, we interviewed 328 women with histologically confirmed breast cancer at five medical centres in Malaysia. Times were measured from recognition of symptoms to first consultation to diagnosis and to the first definitive treatment. The event was initiation of definitive treatment. Data was analysed using multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression.
RESULTS: The mean age was 47.9 (standard deviation 9.4) years and 79.9\% were ethnic Malays. The median follow-up time was 6.9 months. The median times for first doctor consultation, diagnosis and initiation of treatment were 2 months, 5.5 months and 2.4 weeks, respectively. The percentage of consultation delay more than a month was 66.8\%, diagnosis delay more than three months was 73.2\% and treatment delay more than one month was 11.6\%. Factors associated with not initiating the definitive treatment were pregnancy (adjusted hazard ratio (AHR) 1.75; 95\% Confidence Interval (CI): 1.07, 2.88), taking complementary alternative medicine (AHR 1.45; 95\% CI: 1.15, 1.83), initial refusal of mastectomy (AHR 3.49; 95\% CI: 2.38, 5.13) and undergoing lumpectomy prior to definitive treatment (AHR 1.62; 95\% CI: 1.16, 2.28).
CONCLUSIONS: Delays in diagnosis and consultation were more serious than treatment delays. Most respondents would accept treatment immediately after diagnosis. Respondents themselves were responsible for a large proportion of the delays. This study was successful in understanding the process of breast cancer patients' experience, from symptoms recognition to consultation, diagnosis and treatment.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Breast cancer incidence is increasing in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Mortality/incidence ratios in LMICs are higher than in high-income countries, likely at least in part because of delayed diagnoses leading to advanced-stage presentations. In the present study, we investigated the magnitude, impact of, and risk factors for, patient and system delays in breast cancer diagnosis in Rwanda.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We interviewed patients with breast complaints at two rural Rwandan hospitals providing cancer care and reviewed their medical records to determine the diagnosis, diagnosis date, and breast cancer stage.
RESULTS: A total of 144 patients were included in our analysis. Median total delay was 15 months, and median patient and system delays were both 5 months. In multivariate analyses, patient and system delays of ≥6 months were significantly associated with more advanced-stage disease. Adjusting for other social, demographic, and clinical characteristics, a low level of education and seeing a traditional healer first were significantly associated with a longer patient delay. Having made ≥5 health facility visits before the diagnosis was significantly associated with a longer system delay. However, being from the same district as one of the two hospitals was associated with a decreased likelihood of system delay.
CONCLUSION: Patients with breast cancer in Rwanda experience long patient and system delays before diagnosis; these delays increase the likelihood of more advanced-stage presentations. Educating communities and healthcare providers about breast cancer and facilitating expedited referrals could potentially reduce delays and hence mortality from breast cancer in Rwanda and similar settings.
IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Breast cancer rates are increasing in low- and middle-income countries, and case fatality rates are high, in part because of delayed diagnosis and treatment. This study examined the delays experienced by patients with breast cancer at two rural Rwandan cancer facilities. Both patient delays (the interval between symptom development and the patient's first presentation to a healthcare provider) and system delays (the interval between the first presentation and diagnosis) were long. The total delays were the longest reported in published studies. Longer delays were associated with more advanced-stage disease. These findings suggest that an opportunity exists to reduce breast cancer mortality in Rwanda by addressing barriers in the community and healthcare system to promote earlier detection.},

	abstract = {Delay in seeking medical attention for breast cancer symptoms, as well as delay in the diagnosing of and delivery of effective treatments for breast cancer may result in advanced states of disease, thereby contributing to breast cancer mortality. Our knowledge of the scope and characteristics of delay in breast cancer is limited. Delay can be divided into two components, patient and system delay. Patient delay is the time it takes for a women to seek help once she has discovered a breast symptom. System delay is the time it takes for a woman to be evaluated, diagnosed, and treated once she has sought help. Most of the studies have dealt with patient delay, with few studies being performed on system delay, especially in the United States. It is evident that patient and system delays of 2-3 months apiece do occur in a small percentage of cases. However, there is not a clear picture of the factors associated with these long delays. Studies have had conflicting results and have often been difficult to compare because of inconsistent definitions of delay. This review critically examines the available literature on delay in breast cancer. Given the lack of a complete understanding regarding the factors associated with long delay, and the fact that the earlier a breast cancer is diagnosed and treated, the greater the likelihood of long-term survival, it is especially important to do further work to determine the factors associated with long delay so that interventions can be designed to minimize delay and thus permit earlier diagnoses and treatments of breast cancers.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Breast cancer has remained the most commonly diagnosed disease among women globally. Despite the advancement in biomedical sciences leading to improve survival outcomes, some patients endure longer wait periods prior to initiation of treatment.
OBJECTIVE: To elucidate the impact of treatment delay on breast cancer patient's quality of life and survivorship. Second was to determine the optimal length of time (delay) between breast cancer diagnosis and start of first treatment in order to improve prognosis and general health and well-being of survivors.
METHODS: Systematic search of the literature was conducted across five electronic databases: Pub Med, EMBASE, CINAHL, Scopus and Science Direct as well as the reference list of all articles retrieved.
RESULTS: A total of 33 articles were included in the evidence based systematic review, which comprised of 255,366 observations. The results of the studies were categorized under five main themes as: study characteristics, cancer staging and classification, treatment delay time definition and interval, treatment regimen classification and delay impact on quality of life and survival. Analyzed wait times from diagnosis to the initiation of first therapy ranged from 7 days to a period of over 180 days. Combinations of standardized treatment including loco-regional radiotherapy, systemic chemotherapy surgery as well as hormonal therapy were examined. Even though some of the studies showed mixed results, overall, findings indicated that early detection, diagnosis and initiation of treatment within 90 days increase survival.
CONCLUSIONS: Evidence revealed that delaying the initiation of treatment for breast cancer more than 90 days after diagnosis has a detrimental effect on disease free and overall well-being of survivors.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patient delay commonly appears in breast cancer (BC), but the findings for influential factors may be contaminated by recall bias. The real factors in patient delay (divided into appraisal delay and utilization delay) for women with BC urgently need to be objectively analyzed for preventing the progression of this disease.
METHODS: Women meeting strict inclusion and exclusion criteria were asked to fill in a questionnaire, which included three sections of sociodemographic characteristics, medical history, and knowledge of BC. Later on, the outcomes were processed according to the verification of BC by pathological diagnosis. Then, multiple linear regression was conducted to analyze the potential factors of the delay and to explore their relations between these factors and BC.
RESULTS: Appraisal delay is the leading component of patient delay. Appraisal delay's time distribution of a higher percentage at delay time 0-29 and {\textgreater}360 days, while other delay time occupies lower percentage, which is highly consistent with that of patient delay, while utilization delay mainly occurs in the 0-29 days period. Concerning the influential factors for the different phases of delay, age (P=0.051, P=0.035 separately in appraisal and patient delay), residential address (P=0.036, P=0.010) and symptom disclosure to others (P=0.015, P=0.015) led to a decrease of appraisal and patient delay. However, reasons for first medical consultation (P=0.033, P=0.006) and knowledge of BC (P=0.027, P=0.002) would accelerate appraisal and patient delay. Many factors related to hospitals, such as hospital category for first medical consultation (P=0.030) and examinations for first medical consultation (P=0.055) would reduce utilization delay.
CONCLUSIONS: Obstacles in medical consultation for younger women should be removed, and early interventions are needed to avoid progression of BC.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine the impact of patient demographics, tumor characteristics, and treatment type on time to treatment (TTT) in patients with breast cancer treated at a safety net medical center with a diverse patient population.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 1,130 patients were diagnosed and treated for breast cancer between 2004 and 2014 at our institution. We retrospectively collected data on patient age at diagnosis, race/ethnicity, primary language spoken, marital status, insurance coverage, American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) stage, hormone receptor status, and treatment dates. TTT was determined from the date of breast cancer biopsy to treatment start date. Nonparametric Mann-Whitney U-test (or Kruskal-Wallis test when appropriate) and multivariable quantile regression models were employed to assess for significant differences in TTT associated with each factor.
RESULTS: Longer median TTT was noted for Black (P=0.002) and single (P=0.002) patients. AJCC stage IV patients had shorter TTT (27.5 days) compared to earlier AJCC patients (36, 35, 37, 37 days for stage 0, I, II, III, respectively), P=0.028. Age, primary language spoken, insurance coverage, and hormone receptor status had no significant impact on TTT. On multivariate analysis, race/ethnicity remained the only significant factor with Black reporting longer TTT, P=0.025. However, race was not a significant factor for time from first to second treatment. More Black patients were noted to be single (P{\textless}0.0001) and received chemotherapy as first treatment (P=0.008) compared to White, Hispanic, or other race/ethnicity patients.
CONCLUSION: In this retrospective analysis, Black patients had longer TTT, were more likely to receive chemotherapy as first treatment, and have a single marital status. These patient factors will help identify vulnerable patients and guide further research to understand the barriers to care and the impact of treatment delays on outcomes.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Breast cancer is the second most common cause of cancer death in Thai women. Cancer registry data reveal a high prevalence of late-stage disease at diagnosis. The factors resulting in delay in Thailand have not yet been investigated.
OBJECTIVES: To determine the extent of, and the factors contributing to, delay in breast cancer care.
DESIGN: Women with breast cancer who were first treated at Songklanagarind Hospital between June 1994 and June 1996 were interviewed with retrospective chart audits of care.
MEASURES: Dependent variables included patient delay (symptom recognition to first care) and system delay (first care to treatment). Independent variables tested included demographic factors, help-seeking behavior, and cancer knowledge. Nonparametric rank sum tests were used for univariate analysis, and Cox regression was used for multivariate analysis.
RESULTS: Ninety-four cases were included in the study. The median patient and system delays were 4 weeks; 26.6\% and 24.4\% of patients, respectively, experienced patient and system delay {\textgreater}12 weeks. Only marital status (unmarried compared with married women) was significantly associated with patient delay (hazard ratio [HR] 2.78, 95\% CI 1.23-6.25). Contacting a provincial hospital instead of a university hospital as first medical care (hazard ratio 2.50, 1.23-5.26), being given a diagnosis rather than being told nothing (HR 2.04, 1.14-3.57) and being given treatment rather than being immediately referred (HR 4.55, 2.22-9.09) were associated with system delay.
CONCLUSIONS: Patient delay and system delay in breast cancer care are important weaknesses of disease control in Thailand. Educational programs should target unmarried women, who are at higher risk of delay. System delay in hospitals outside the university needs to be improved by a good referral system.},

After adjustment for socio-demographic and clinical factors, compared to women living in very high accessibility areas, women in high (Odds Ratio (OR) 0.58 (95\% confidence intervals (CI) 0.49, 0.69)), low (OR 0.47 (0.41, 0.54)) and very low (OR 0.44 (0.34, 0.56)) accessibility areas had lower odds of having BCS, while  the odds for women from middle (OR 0.81 (0.69, 0.94)) and most disadvantaged (OR 0.87 (0.71, 0.98)) areas was significantly lower than women living in affluent areas. The association between accessibility and the type of surgery reduced over time (interaction p = 0.028) but not for area disadvantage (interaction p = 0.209). In making informed decisions about surgical treatment, it is crucial that any geographical-related barriers to implementing their preferred treatment are minimised.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To describe the use of telemedicine in cancer care (teleoncology model of care) for rural patients in North Queensland.
DESIGN: This is a descriptive study. Data on demographical and clinical factors were retrieved from the teleoncology database of Townsville Hospital and review of medical records for the period between May 2007 and May 2011.
SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: The medical oncologists at the Townsville Cancer Centre, a regional cancer centre in North Queensland, have been providing their services to rural hospitals in Townsville and Mt Isa districts via videoconferencing since 2007.
INTERVENTION: Cancer care delivery to rural sites via Townsville teleoncology model.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The ability of the teleoncology model to provide the following services to rural towns: (i) specialist consultations; (ii) urgent specialist medical care; (iii) care for Indigenous patients; and (iv) remote supervision of chemotherapy administration.
RESULTS: Between May 2007 and May 2011, 158 patients from 18 rural towns received a total of 745 consultations. Ten of these patients were consulted urgently and treatment plans initiated locally, avoiding interhospital transfers. Eighteen Indigenous patients received consultative services, being accompanied by more than four to six family members. Eighty-three patients received a range of intravenous and oral chemotherapy regimens in Mt Isa and oral agents in other towns through remote supervision by medical oncologists from Townsville.
CONCLUSION: Teleoncology model of care allows rural and Indigenous cancer patients to receive specialist consultations and chemotherapy treatments closer to home, thus minimising the access difficulties faced by the rural sector.},

	abstract = {PROBLEM: Prior to 2009, the teleoncology model of the Townsville Cancer Centre (TCC) did not achieve its aims of equal waiting times for rural and urban patients and the provision of reliable, local acute cancer care. From 2007-2009, 60 new patients from Mt Isa travelled to TCC for their first consultation and their first dose of chemotherapy. Six of these patients required inter-hospital transfers and eight required urgent flights to attend outpatient clinics. Only 50\% these rural patients (n = 30) were reviewed within one week of their referral, compared with 90\% of Townsville patients.
DESIGN: A descriptive study.
SETTING: TCC provides teleoncology services to 21 rural towns; the largest is Mt Isa, Qld.
KEY MEASURES FOR IMPROVEMENT: Specialist review of 90\% of urgent cases within 24 hours, and 90\% of non-urgent cases within one week of referral via videoconferencing. A 50\% reduction in inpatient inter-hospital transfers from Mt Isa to Townsville.
STRATEGIES FOR CHANGE: Employment of a half-time medical officer and a half-time cancer care coordinator, and implementation of new policies.
EFFECTS OF CHANGE: Between 2009 and 2011, TCC provided cancer care to 70 new patients from Mt Isa. Of these new patients, 93\% (65/70) were seen within one week of referral. All 17 patients requiring urgent reviews were seen within 24 hours of referral and managed locally thus eliminating the need for inpatient inter-hospital transfers.
LESSONS LEARNT: Provision of timely acute cancer care closer to home requires an increase in the rural case complexity and human resources.},

A variety of medical models of teleoncology exist to provide various medical oncology services. While most centers use teleoncology to complement their face-to-face outreach services, some centers have replaced face-to-face with teleoncology models. Selection of patients and scheduling of clinics would depend on various factors including experience of the clinicians, complexity of treatment provided, capabilities and workforce of rural sites, and patient preferences. Many small studies reported high satisfaction rates of these models among patients and health professionals including Indigenous populations. One single center study reports that it is safe to supervise chemotherapy delivery remotely and many studies report cost savings to the health systems. Further studies on safety aspects of teleoncology are needed to further improve the current models. Future teleoncology models would need to include Web-based models, mobile technologies and remote chemotherapy supervision models so that patients from most rural towns could have at least some of their cancer care closer to home.},

DESIGN: Descriptive study, using semistructured interviews.
SETTING: Tertiary referral centre (Townsville Cancer Centre) and various rural and remote towns in Queensland.
KEY MEASURES FOR IMPROVEMENT: Satisfaction levels of Indigenous patients, their family members and Indigenous HWs with various aspects of the teleoncology service.
LESSONS LEARNT: Our evaluation suggests that teleoncology is an acceptable model of care for Indigenous patients, with high levels of satisfaction expressed from patients, families and HWs. Health professionals involved with providing this service need to be adaptive to the needs of individual patients and local communities in order to provide culturally appropriate care. Formal skills training for staff, effective communication between specialist and local HWs, and informed consent procedures are essential to maintain safety of practices. Strategies for change are: • Mandatory informed consent procedure for all patients offered with VC. • Formalised competency training for staff in skills essential to maintain safe practices in teleoncology. • Clear clinical documentation to facilitate improved communication in patient management between medical staff at main centre and distant sites. • Further efforts in promotion, education and support for staff to participate in telemedicine.},

Treatments have become less "invasive", with greater precision and efficiency. Patients can therefore receive most of their care outside of hospitals. The development of e-health can address these new imperatives. In this letter, we describe the different e-health tools and their potential clinical impacts in oncology, as already reported at every level of care, including education, prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and monitoring. A few randomized studies have yet demonstrated the clinical benefit. We also comment on issues and limits of "cancer outside the hospital walls" from the point of view of patients, health care professionals, health facilities, and public authorities. Care providers in hospitals and communities will have to adapt to these changes within well-coordinated networks in order to better meet patient expectations regarding increasing education and personalizing management. Ultimately, controlled studies should aim to definitively demonstrate areas of interest, benefits, and incentives, for not only patients, but also caregivers (formal and informal) and health care providers, health care facilities, and the nation.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To systematically assess the evidence for variations in outcomes at each step along the breast cancer continuum of care for Australian women by residential location.
DESIGN: Systematic review.
METHODS: Systematic searches of peer-reviewed articles in English published from 1 January 1990 to 24 November 2017 using PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL and Informit databases. Inclusion criteria were: population was adult female patients with breast cancer; Australian setting; outcome measure was survival, patient or tumour characteristics, screening rates or frequencies, clinical management, patterns of initial care or post-treatment follow-up with analysis by residential location or studies involving non-metropolitan women only. Included studies were critically appraised using a modified Newcastle-Ottawa Scale.
RESULTS: Seventy-four quantitative studies met the inclusion criteria. Around 59\% were considered high quality, 34\% moderate and 7\% low. No eligible studies examining treatment choices or post-treatment follow-up were identified. Non-metropolitan women consistently had poorer survival, with most of this differential being attributed to more advanced disease at diagnosis, treatment-related factors and socioeconomic disadvantage. Compared with metropolitan women, non-metropolitan women were more likely to live in disadvantaged areas and had differing clinical management and patterns of care. However, findings regarding geographical variations in tumour characteristics or diagnostic outcomes were inconsistent.
CONCLUSIONS: A general pattern of poorer survival and variations in clinical management for Australian female patients with breast cancer from non-metropolitan areas was evident. However, the wide variability in data sources, measures, study quality, time periods and geographical classification made direct comparisons across studies challenging. The review highlighted the need to promote standardisation of geographical classifications and increased comparability of data systems. It also identified key gaps in the existing literature including a lack of studies on advanced breast cancer, geographical variations in treatment choices from the perspective of patients and post-treatment follow-up.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The purpose of the present study was to examine the effects of demographic, locational and social disadvantage and the possession of private health insurance in Western Australia on the likelihood of women with breast cancer receiving breast-conserving surgery rather than mastectomy.
METHODS: The WA Record Linkage Project was used to extract all hospital morbidity, cancer and death records of women with breast cancer in Western Australia from 1982 to 2000 inclusive. Comparisons between those receiving breast-conserving surgery and mastectomy were made after adjustment for covariates in logistic regression.
RESULTS: Younger women, especially those aged less than 60 years, and those with less comorbidity were more likely to receive breast-conserving surgery (BCS). In lower socio-economic groups, women were less likely to receive BCS (OR 0.73; 95\% CI 0.60-0.90). Women resident in rural areas tended to receive less BCS than those from metropolitan areas (OR 0.84; 95\% CI 0.55-1.29). Women treated in a rural hospital had a reduced likelihood of BCS (OR 0.74; 95\% CI 0.61-0.89). Treatment in a private hospital reduced the likelihood of BCS (OR 0.70; 95\% CI 0.54-0.90), while women with private health insurance were much more likely to receive BCS (OR 1.39; 95\% CI 1.08-1.79).
CONCLUSION: Several factors were found to affect the likelihood of women with breast cancer receiving breast-conserving surgery, in particular, women from disadvantaged backgrounds were significantly less likely to receive breast-conserving surgery than those from more privileged groups.},

	abstract = {For a very broad range of problems, recommendation algorithms have been increasingly used over the past decade. In most of these algorithms, the predictions are built upon user-item affinity scores which are obtained from high-dimensional embeddings of items and users. In more complex scenarios, with geometrical or capacity constraints, prediction based on embeddings may not be sufficient and some additional features should be considered in the design of the algorithm. In this work, we study the recommendation problem in the setting where affinities between users and items are based both on their embeddings in a latent space and on their geographical distance in their underlying euclidean space (e.g., \${\textbackslash}mathbb\{R\}{\textasciicircum}2\$), together with item capacity constraints. This framework is motivated by some real-world applications, for instance in healthcare: the task is to recommend hospitals to patients based on their location, pathology, and hospital capacities. In these applications, there is somewhat of an asymmetry between users and items: items are viewed as static points, their embeddings, capacities and locations constraining the allocation. Upon the observation of an optimal allocation, user embeddings, items capacities, and their positions in their underlying euclidean space, our aim is to recover item embeddings in the latent space; doing so, we are then able to use this estimate e.g. in order to predict future allocations. We propose an algorithm (SiMCa) based on matrix factorization enhanced with optimal transport steps to model user-item affinities and learn item embeddings from observed data. We then illustrate and discuss the results of such an approach for hospital recommendation on synthetic data.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Gynaecological cancers are the second most common cancers among women. It has been suggested that centralised care improves outcomes but consensus is lacking.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness of centralisation of care for patients with gynaecological cancer.
SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Gynaecological Cancer Group Trials Register, CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library, Issue 4, 2010), MEDLINE, and EMBASE up to November 2010. We also searched registers of clinical trials, abstracts of scientific meetings, and reference lists of included studies.
SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-RCTs, controlled before-and-after studies, interrupted time series studies, and observational studies that examined centralisation of services for gynaecological cancer, and used multivariable analysis to adjust for baseline case mix.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Three review authors independently extracted data, and two assessed risk of bias. Where possible, we synthesised the data on survival in a meta-analysis.
MAIN RESULTS: Five studies met our inclusion criteria; all were retrospective observational studies and therefore at high risk of bias.Meta-analysis of three studies assessing over 9000 women suggested that institutions with gynaecologic oncologists on site may prolong survival in women with ovarian cancer, compared to community or general hospitals: hazard ratio (HR) of death was 0.90 (95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.82 to 0.99). Similarly, another meta-analysis of three studies assessing over 50,000 women, found that teaching centres or regional cancer centres may prolong survival in women with any gynaecological cancer compared to community or general hospitals (HR 0.91; 95\% CI 0.84 to 0.99). The largest of these studies included all gynaecological malignancies and assessed 48,981 women, so the findings extend beyond ovarian cancer. One study compared community hospitals with semi-specialised gynaecologists versus general hospitals and reported non-significantly better disease-specific survival in women with ovarian cancer (HR 0.89; 95\% CI 0.78 to 1.01). The findings of included studies were highly consistent. Adverse event data were not reported in any of the studies.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We found low quality, but consistent evidence to suggest that women with gynaecological cancer who received treatment in specialised centres had longer survival than those managed elsewhere. The evidence was stronger for ovarian cancer than for other gynaecological cancers.Further studies of survival are needed, with more robust designs than retrospective observational studies. Research should also assess the quality of life associated with centralisation of gynaecological cancer care. Most of the available evidence addresses ovarian cancer in developed countries; future studies should be extended to other gynaecological cancers within different healthcare systems.},

Interventions “Hub and spoke” model for acute stroke care. In London hyperacute care was provided to all patients with stroke. In Greater Manchester hyperacute care was provided to patients presenting within four hours of developing symptoms of stroke.
Main outcome measures Mortality from any cause and at any place at 3, 30, and 90 days after hospital admission; length of hospital stay.
Results In London there was a significant decline in risk adjusted mortality at 3, 30, and 90 days after admission. At 90 days the absolute reduction was −1.1\% (95\% confidence interval −2.1 to −0.1; relative reduction 5\%), indicating 168 fewer deaths (95\% confidence interval 19 to 316) during the 21 month period after reconfiguration in London. In both areas there was a significant decline in risk adjusted length of hospital stay: −2.0 days in Greater Manchester (95\% confidence interval −2.8 to −1.2; 9\%) and −1.4 days in London (−2.3 to −0.5; 7\%). Reductions in mortality and length of hospital stay were largely seen among patients with ischaemic stroke.
Conclusions A centralised model of acute stroke care, in which hyperacute care is provided to all patients with stroke across an entire metropolitan area, can reduce mortality and length of hospital stay.},

	abstract = {The election of the Labour government last year shifted the issue of inequality in health to the top of the policy agenda. In its White Paper on the “New NHS”, promises were made about reducing unacceptable variations in services and ensuring fair access. Publication of the Green Paper “Our Healthier Nation” also reinforced the government’s aim of narrowing the health gap. Several national initiatives also have this aim, including the £30 million investment in Health Action Zones which are to target health inequalities and the establishment of a public enquiry into health inequalities, chaired by Sir Donald Acheson. However, much of the action required to tackle inequality will have to be undertaken at a local level. Indeed, the White Paper gave Health Authorities, in conjunction with other organisations inside and outside the NHS, the key task of improving health and reducing inequalities through their Health Improvement Programmes. If this task is to me manageable, those in the NHS will need to disentangle the many and complex stands involved in understanding the issue of inequality in health. This report attempts to clarify what is known in relationship to one of those issues – equity of access to health care services – and to draw out the policy implications of the research on this topic. Following an overview of methodological issues, research evidence on the extent and cause of inequities of access to services in the following five areas is summarised and analysed: GP consultations, acute care, mental illness, prevention and health promotion and long-term care. The policy and research implications are drawn out and some suggestions for future directions are made. The report is aimed at both policy makers and academics interested in the state of existing research and in designing and implementing their own studies into equity of access.},

	abstract = {Denmark has a tradition of a decentralized health system. However, during recent years, reforms and policy initiatives  have gradually centralized the health system in different ways. The structural reform of 2007 merged the old counties  into fewer bigger regions, and the old municipalities likewise. The hospital structure is undergoing similar reforms,  with fewer, bigger and more specialized hospitals. Furthermore, a more centralized approach to planning and regulation  has been taking place over recent years. This is evident in the new national planning of medical specialties as well  as the establishment of a nationwide accreditation system, the Danish Healthcare Quality Programme, which sets national  standards for health system providers in Denmark. Efforts have also been made to ensure coherent patient pathways -  at the moment for cancer and heart disease - that are similar nationwide. These efforts also aim at improving  intersectoral cooperation. Financially, recent years have seen the introduction of a higher degree of activity-based  financing in the public health sector, combined with the traditional global budgeting.A number of challenges remain in the Danish  health care system. The consequences of the recent reforms and centralization initiatives are yet to be fully evaluated.  Before this happens, a full overview of what future reforms should target is not possible. Denmark continues to lag  behind the other Nordic countries in regards to some health indicators, such as life expectancy. A number of risk  factors may be the cause of this: alcohol intake and obesity continue to be problems, whereas smoking habits are improving.  The level of socioeconomic inequalities in health also continues to be a challenge. The organization of the Danish health  care system will have to take a number of challenges into account in the future. These include changes in disease patterns,  with an ageing population with chronic and long-term diseases; ensuring sufficient staffing; and deciding how to improve  public health initiatives that target prevention of diseases and favour health improvements.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Data on the survival of all incident cases collected by population-based cancer registries make it possible to evaluate the overall performance of diagnostic and therapeutic actions on cancer in those populations. EUROCARE-3 is the third round of the EUROCARE project, the largest cancer registry population based collaborative study on survival in European cancer patients. The EUROCARE-3 study analysed the survival of cancer patients diagnosed from 1990 to 1994 and followed-up to 1999. Sixty-seven cancer registries of 22 European countries characterised by differing health systems participated in the study. This paper includes essays providing brief overviews of the state and evolution of the health systems of the considered countries and comments on the relation between cancer survival in Europe and some European macro-economic and health system indicators, in the 1990s.
OVERVIEW OF THE EUROPEAN HEALTH SYSTEMS: The European health systems underwent a great deal of reorganisation in the last decade; a general tendency being to facilitate expanding involvement of the private sector in health care, a process which occurred mainly in the eastern countries (i.e. the Czech Republic, Estonia, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia). In contrast, organisational changes in the northern European countries (i.e. Denmark, Iceland, Finland and Sweden) tended to confirm the established public sector systems. Other countries, including the UK and some southern European countries (i.e. England, Scotland, Wales, Malta and Italy) have reduced the public role while the systems remain basically public, at least at present. Our findings clearly suggest that cancer survival (all cancer combined) is related to macro-economic variables such as the gross domestic product (GDP), the total national (public and private) expenditure on health (TNEH) and the total public expenditure on health (TPEH). We found, however, that survival is related to wealth (GDP), but only up to a certain level, after which survival continues to be related to the level of health investment (both TNEH and TPEH). According to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the TNEH increased during the 1990s in all EUROCARE-3 countries, while the ratio of TPEH to TNEH reduced in all countries except Portugal.
CONCLUSIONS: Cancer survival depends on the widespread application of effective diagnosis and treatment modalities, but our enquiry suggests that the availability of these depends on macro-economic determinants, including health and public health investment. Analysis of the relationship between health system organisation and cancer outcome is complicated and requires more information than is at present available. To describe cancer and cancer management in Europe, the European Cancer Health Indicator Project (EUROCHIP) has proposed a list of indicators that have to be adopted to evaluate the effects on outcome of proposed health system modifications.},

	volume = {5},
	issn = {1065-4704},
	abstract = {PURPOSE: Patients with cancer must overcome many psychological, social, and economic barriers to obtain needed treatment. Because of the need for repeated visits for cancer treatment on either an outpatient or an inpatient basis, one of the major issues that patients with cancer must confront is that of arranging for transportation to care.
METHODS: This study compares the distance and mode of transportation to radiotherapy and chemotherapy and perceptions of transportation as a barrier to care among white, black, and Hispanic cancer patients receiving treatment from a consortium of cancer treatment facilities in Texas. A mail questionnaire was developed to assess the perceived barriers to cancer treatment for patients who had been diagnosed clinically with breast, colon, cervical, or prostate cancer, or lymphoma between 1989 and 1993. A total of 910 surveys were mailed to prospective participants. Of the surveys mailed, 593 were returned, yielding a 65.2\% response rate. By race, the respondents included whites (42\%), blacks (40\%), Hispanics (15\%), and Asian-Pacific Islanders (3\%). Two respondents were 17 years of age; the remaining respondents were 18 years or older.
RESULTS: This study shows that some patients may forgo needed treatment because of problems with transportation. This was perceived as an issue more for minority patients than for white patients. Black and Hispanic patients consistently reported that barriers such as distance, access to an automobile, and availability of someone to drive them to the treatment center were potential major problems. The distance to the facilities was farther for whites than for blacks and Hispanics. Patients generally had to travel farther for chemotherapy than for radiotherapy.
CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Patients, particularly minorities, may opt to forgo needed care in the absence of available and affordable means of transportation to treatment facilities. These findings demonstrate the need for healthcare providers to be aware of the transportation problems that patients with cancer experience in obtaining treatment. Healthcare providers must work with patients, their families, and volunteer agencies in the community to facilitate transportation to cancer treatment services.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Treatment access underlies quality cancer care. We hypothesize that mastectomy rates in a rural state are independently influenced by distance to radiation therapy (XRT) and by changing XRT access through opening new facilities.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Early-stage breast cancer patients diagnosed from 1996 to 2000 were identified in the Virginia state registry. Distance from patient zip code to nearest XRT facility was calculated with geographical software. Distance to XRT facility ({\textless} or = 10, {\textgreater} 10 to 25, {\textgreater} 25 to 50, and {\textgreater} 50 miles), American Joint Committee on Cancer tumor stage, age, race, and diagnosis year were evaluated for influencing mastectomy rate. Mastectomy use within 15 miles of five new facilities was assessed before and after opening.
RESULTS: Among 20,094 patients, 43\% underwent mastectomy, 53\% underwent lumpectomy, and therapy of 4\% of patients is unknown. Twenty-nine percent of patients lived more than 10 miles from XRT facility. Mastectomy increased with distance to XRT facility (43\% at {\textless} or = 10 miles, 47\% at {\textgreater} 10 to 25 miles, 53\% at {\textgreater} 25 to 50 miles, and 58\% at {\textgreater} 50 miles; P {\textless} .001). Among 11,597 patients with T1 ({\textless} 2 cm) tumors, mastectomy also varied by distance (31\% at {\textless} or = 10 miles, 36\% at {\textgreater} 10 to 25 miles, 41\% at {\textgreater} 25 to 50 miles, and 49\% at {\textgreater} 50 miles; P {\textless} .001). In multivariate analysis, mastectomy use was independently influenced by XRT distance after adjusting for age, race, T stage, and diagnosis year. Over the study period, mastectomy rates declined from 48\% to 43\% across Virginia, and there were similar declines in a 15-mile area around four new radiation facilities in urban settings. However, mastectomies decreased from 61\% to 45\% around a new XRT facility in a rural setting.
CONCLUSION: Distance to XRT facility significantly impacts mastectomy use. Opportunities for increasing breast-conservation rates through improved XRT access exist.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Current standards of care for early-stage breast cancer include either breast-conserving surgery (BCS) with post-operative radiation or mastectomy. A variety of factors influence the type of treatment chosen. In northern, rural areas, daily travel for radiation can be difficult in winter. We investigated whether proximity to a radiation treatment facility (RTF) and season of diagnosis affected treatment choice for New Hampshire women with early-stage breast cancer.
METHODS: Using a population-based cancer registry, we identified all women residents of New Hampshire diagnosed with stage I or II breast cancer during 1998-2000. We assessed factors influencing treatment choices using multivariate logistic regression.
RESULTS: New Hampshire women with early-stage breast cancer were less likely to choose BCS if they live further from a RTF (P {\textless} 0.001). Of those electing BCS, radiation was less likely to be used by women living {\textgreater}20 miles from a RTF (P = 0.002) and those whose diagnosis was made during winter (P = 0.031).
CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that a substantial fraction of women with early-stage breast cancer in New Hampshire receive suboptimal treatment by forgoing radiation because of the difficulty traveling for radiation in winter. Future treatment planning strategies should consider these barriers to care in cold rural regions.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Breast-conserving surgery combined with radiation (BCSR) is the recommended alternative treatment to mastectomy for local breast carcinoma. However, limited access to healthcare may result in more extensive surgical treatment. The effect of distance to radiation therapy facilities on the likelihood of receiving BCSR was examined in Florida.
METHODS: Local breast carcinomas reported to Florida's statewide registry between July, 1997, and December, 2000 were linked to the Agency of Healthcare Administration inpatient and outpatient databases to supplement the registry's treatment data, resulting in 18,903 local breast carcinoma cases treated with BCSR or mastectomy. The odds of receiving BCSR were modeled as a function of distance to the closest radiation therapy facility, adjusting for health insurance, age, race/ethnicity, and marital status.
RESULTS: Distance to the closest radiation therapy facility was negatively associated with BCSR, with the odds ratio (OR) decreasing by 3\% per 5-mile increase in distance. Compared with the uninsured, privately insured women were 49\% more likely to receive BCSR (OR of 1.49; 95\% confidence interval [95\% CI], 1.20-1.86) and Medicare patients were 37\% more likely (OR of 1.37; 95\% CI, 1.09-1.72). Age at diagnosis was negatively associated, reducing the odds of BCSR by 1\% per year increase in age. Compared with white non-Hispanic, Hispanic women were 38\% less likely to receive BCSR (OR of 0.62; 95\% CI, 0.55-0.71). Married women were 23\% more likely to receive BCSR compared with singles (OR of 1.23; 95\% CI, 1.09-1.40); women who were separated, divorced, or widowed did not differ significantly from single women.
CONCLUSIONS: Distance to radiation therapy facilities may negatively impact the likelihood of BCSR in Florida. Age at diagnosis, insurance type, race/ethnicity, and marital status were associated with BCSR. Future efforts should target the uninsured, Hispanics, the elderly, and the unmarried women to reduce disparities in the administration of BCSR for local breast carcinoma.},

Aim:
This study was an attempt to find out the important causes of this non-compliance to treatment in a rural Medical College Hospital where majority of the cancer cases are of cervical cancer.

Results:
Out of 144 patients studied over 2 years 88 cases could not complete the treatment. The study revealed that due old age 58.33\% cases were defaulters, having many children at home meant a burden to 76.92\% cases and 63.89\% cases had a problem of not been able to travel a far distance of more than 100 km from home to hospital for treatment.

Conclusion:
These were the important factors of non-compliance and suggested more important than the issues of literacy and poor socio-economic status.},

Methods: We linked cancer registry records to hospital records for 3749 women with ovarian cancer diagnosed between 2000 and 2008 in New South Wales, Australia. Access to a GOS was measured in kilometers from a woman's geocoded address to the geocoded address of the closest public GOS hospital. Flexible parametric survival, Cox proportional hazards, and logistic regression models were fitted to examine whether better access to a GOS was associated with a better survival and whether extensive surgery was received for ovarian cancer after adjustment for patient, tumor, and treatment factors. Results: Hazard of death from ovarian cancer was greater in women who were treated in a public general hospital than in women treated in a GOS hospital (hazards ratio, 0.77; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.64-0.95), and greater in those who did not have extensive surgery than in those who did (hazards ratio, 0.47; 95\% CI, 0.38-0.58). The further women with ovarian cancer lived from a public GOS hospital, the more likely they were to be treated in a public general hospital. Women were 19 times more likely (odds ratio, 19.40; 95\% CI, 13.92-27.04) to be treated only in a general hospital when they lived 187 km or more from a public GOS hospital than women who lived within 5 km of one. Conclusions: Distance of residence from GOS hospitals in Australia is an important determinant of access to GOS hospitals. Treatment in a public or private GOS hospital and having surgery were the strongest predictors of survival from epithelial ovarian cancer. Research is required into the barriers to referral of patients with ovarian cancer for care in GOS hospitals; low population density limits options for supply of GOS in rural areas.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine whether an association exists between distance from radiotherapy facilities and survival outcomes of people diagnosed with rectal cancer.
DESIGN AND SETTING: Descriptive population-based study using data from the Queensland Cancer Registry.
PATIENTS: All patients aged 20-79 years (n = 6848) diagnosed with invasive rectal cancer between 1 January 1996 and 31 December 2006.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Cause-specific survival.
RESULTS: The 5-year cause-specific survival was 62\% (95\% CI, 61\%-64\%); it was strongly influenced by stage at diagnosis (American Joint Committee on Cancer, Stages I-IV), ranging from 86\% (Stage I) to 9\% (Stage IV). After adjusting for age, sex, and stage at diagnosis, patients who lived 100-199 km, 200-399 km and 400 km or more from a radiotherapy facility were 16\%, 30\%, and 25\%, respectively, more likely to die from rectal cancer than patients living within 50 km of such a facility. On average, there was a 6\% increase in mortality risk (95\% CI, 3\%-8\%; P {\textless} 0.001) for each 100 km increment in distance from the nearest radiotherapy facility. Shared frailty models showed that this association persisted after adjusting for the correlation between individual cancer patients living in the same remoteness or area-level socioeconomic status categories.
CONCLUSIONS: While centralisation of cancer treatment services has merit, our study provides evidence of a shorter survival for people with rectal cancer who live relatively far from radiotherapy facilities. It remains a priority to develop and implement policy, cultural and clinical measures to reduce the burden faced by rural and remote patients with rectal cancer.},

Method Population-based study of cancer registry records for 27 033 people with lung cancer diagnosed in New South Wales, Australia, between 2000 and 2008 linked to hospital admission records. This analysis includes 3240 patients with localized NSCLC admitted to hospital within 12 months of diagnosis. Results Patients who lived 100+ km from the NASH were more likely to have no surgery (50.6\%) than those living 0–39 km away (37.6\%) and more likely to attend general hospitals for their care (52.2\% at 100+ km, 14.8\% at 0–39 km). Relative to patients living 0–39 km from the NASH and attending a specialist hospital for their care, the odds ratio (OR) of not having surgery was high if patients attended a general hospital (adjusted OR 5.99, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 3.87–9.26, for those 0–39 km distant) and even higher as distance from the NASH increased (24.68, 95\% CI 12.37–49.13 for 40–49 km and 30.10, 95\% CI 18.2–49.40 for 100+ km). For patients treated in specialist hospitals (public or private), the trend with distance was opposite: relative to 0–39 km, the OR was 0.29 (95\% CI 0.15–0.50) at 40–99 km and 0.14 (95\% CI 0.08–0.26) at 100+ km.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine whether patients from regional areas undergoing surgery for kidney cancer present with more advanced disease as a result of geographic isolation.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Retrospective analysis of 221 patients undergoing surgery for renal cell carcinoma (RCC) from January 2004 to June 2012, from both a metropolitan centre and a large inner regional hospital. Data was collected on age, gender, presentation (incidental or symptomatic), clinical stage and pathological features. The Australian Standard Geographical Classification-Remoteness Area (ASGC-RA) is a system developed to allow quantitative comparisons between metropolitan and rural Australia. A score was assigned to each patient based on their location of residence at the time of surgery: metropolitan, RA1; inner regional, RA2; outer regional, RA3. Statistical significance was specified as P {\textless} 0.05 on Pearson's chi-square tests.
RESULTS: Patients in each ASGC-RA group did not differ significantly in age, sex or mode of presentation. Pathological T stage on presentation increased with increasing ASGC-RA and thus distance from tertiary centres (P = 0.004). The proportion of patients with ≥T3 disease rose from 30\% of RA1 to 73\% of RA3 patients (P = 0.016) treated at our tertiary centre. Similarly, our regional centre had a larger proportion of patients presenting with ≥T3 disease from RA3 (31\% vs 5\%, P = 0.003). When the 221 patients with RCC were analysed as a group, clinical T stage was significantly associated with ASGC-RA (P {\textless} 0.001), symptomatic presentation (P {\textless} 0.001), N stage (P {\textless} 0.001), M stage (P {\textless} 0.001) and Fuhrman grade (P {\textless} 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Our data quantifies the detrimental effect of physical distance on the health outcomes of regional Australians with kidney cancer. Australia's unique geography and rural culture may preclude any attempts to centralise cancer care to specialised metropolitan units, as has occurred in other countries.},

All hospitals in the South West region of England participating in the Regional Cancer Organisation’s longitudinal study of outcomes in gynaecological malignancies are included. Six hundred and eighty-two patients with epithelial ovarian cancer were registered with the RCO in the two-year study period. Five hundred and ninety-five women were offered primary cytoreductive surgery of which 438 were said to be optimally cytoreduced. Applying multivariate models to analyse the outcome of surgery, older patients (OR = 0.82 per 5-year increase in age, P = 0.0003), patients treated in hospitals managing fewer than ten cases of ovarian cancer per year (OR = 1.92, P = 0.02) and patients with FIGO stage 3 (OR = 0.02, P {\textless} 0.0001) or 4 (OR = 0.002, P {\textless} 0.0001) disease were less likely to be optimally cytoreduced.

	abstract = {Objective To quantify the association of cancer treatment delay and mortality for each four week increase in delay to inform cancer treatment pathways.
Design Systematic review and meta-analysis.
Data sources Published studies in Medline from 1 January 2000 to 10 April 2020.
Eligibility criteria for selecting studies Curative, neoadjuvant, and adjuvant indications for surgery, systemic treatment, or radiotherapy for cancers of the bladder, breast, colon, rectum, lung, cervix, and head and neck were included. The main outcome measure was the hazard ratio for overall survival for each four week delay for each indication. Delay was measured from diagnosis to first treatment, or from the completion of one treatment to the start of the next. The primary analysis only included high validity studies controlling for major prognostic factors. Hazard ratios were assumed to be log linear in relation to overall survival and were converted to an effect for each four week delay. Pooled effects were estimated using DerSimonian and Laird random effect models.
Results The review included 34 studies for 17 indications (n=1 272 681 patients). No high validity data were found for five of the radiotherapy indications or for cervical cancer surgery. The association between delay and increased mortality was significant (P{\textless}0.05) for 13 of 17 indications. Surgery findings were consistent, with a mortality risk for each four week delay of 1.06-1.08 (eg, colectomy 1.06, 95\% confidence interval 1.01 to 1.12; breast surgery 1.08, 1.03 to 1.13). Estimates for systemic treatment varied (hazard ratio range 1.01-1.28). Radiotherapy estimates were for radical radiotherapy for head and neck cancer (hazard ratio 1.09, 95\% confidence interval 1.05 to 1.14), adjuvant radiotherapy after breast conserving surgery (0.98, 0.88 to 1.09), and cervix cancer adjuvant radiotherapy (1.23, 1.00 to 1.50). A sensitivity analysis of studies that had been excluded because of lack of information on comorbidities or functional status did not change the findings.
Conclusions Cancer treatment delay is a problem in health systems worldwide. The impact of delay on mortality can now be quantified for prioritisation and modelling. Even a four week delay of cancer treatment is associated with increased mortality across surgical, systemic treatment, and radiotherapy indications for seven cancers. Policies focused on minimising system level delays to cancer treatment initiation could improve population level survival outcomes.},

	abstract = {Objectives
To evaluate the impact of centralized surgical and nonsurgical care (i.e., radiation and chemotherapy) on travel distances and survival outcomes for patients with advanced bladder cancer. Bladder cancer is a disease with high mortality for which treatment access is paramount and survival is superior in patients receiving surgery at high-volume centers.
Methods
Using SEER-Medicare, we identified patients 66 years or older diagnosed with bladder cancer between 2004-2013. We categorized patients as treated with either surgical (i.e., radical cystectomy) or nonsurgical (i.e., radiation or chemotherapy) care. We fit a linear probability model to generate the predicted proportion of patients treated at the top quintile of volume over time and assessed travel distance, 1-year all-cause mortality, and 1-year bladder cancer-specific mortality over time.
Results
A total of 6,756 and 10,383 patients underwent surgical and nonsurgical care, respectively. The percentage of patients treated at high-volume centers increased over the study period for both surgical care (53\% to 62\%) and nonsurgical care (47\% to 55\%), (both P{\textless} 0.001). Median travel distance increased (11.8 to 20.3 miles) for surgical care and (6.5 to 8.3 miles) for nonsurgical care, (both P {\textless} 0.001). The 1-year adjusted all-cause mortality and 1-year adjusted bladder-cancer specific mortality decreased significantly for both surgical and nonsurgical care (both P {\textless} 0.05).
Conclusions
Over time, centralization of surgical and nonsurgical care for bladder cancer patients increased, which was associated with increasing patient travel distance and decreased all-cause and bladder-cancer specific mortality.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Hospital and surgeon volumes independently explain variations in outcomes for a host of surgical procedures. However, the mediators of the volume effect remain unclear. We assessed whether differences among hospitals could explain some or all of the volume effect on short-term outcomes after cystectomy for bladder cancer.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using the Nationwide Inpatient Sample a 20\% sampling of hospital discharges in the United States and the American Hospital Association file we applied International Classification of Diseased, 9th revision, clinical modification procedure codes to identify 1,847 patients who underwent cystectomy for bladder cancer in 2003. Multivariable mixed models were fit to quantify the differences in measures of hospital structure (capacity, staffing and health services) by hospital volume. Separate models were fit to determine the impact of accounting for these differences on the volume-outcome relationship.
RESULTS: There were substantial differences in hospital structure according to radical cystectomy volume, including those characterizing capacity, staffing levels and the breadth of available health services. For example, 40.7\% of low and 87.8\% of high volume hospitals for radical cystectomy offered open heart surgery (OR 10.4, 95\% CI 1.3-85.3). After adjusting for case mix patients treated at low volume centers were 3.2 times (95\% CI 0.8-13.4) more likely to die postoperatively. Accounting for differences in hospital structure attenuated the volume effect by 59\% (OR 1.9, 95\% CI 0.4-8.6).
CONCLUSIONS: Measurable differences in the availability and breadth of consultative, diagnostic and ancillary services may at least partially explain the association between procedure volume and short-term cystectomy outcomes.},

We argue that this is due to the specifics of benchmarking criteria in medical scenarios and the multitude of drastically differing end-user groups and the enormous context-complexity of the medical domain. Here both risk perceptions towards data security and privacy as well as trust in safe technical systems play a central and specific role, particularly in the clinical context. These aspects dominate acceptance of such systems. By using a Doctor-in-the-Loop approach some of these difficulties could be mitigated by combining both human expertise with computer efficiency. We provide a three-part research framework to access health recommender systems, suggesting to incorporate domain understanding, evaluation and specific methodology into the development process.},

These latent representations encode social relations in a continuous vector space, which is easily exploited by statistical models. DeepWalk generalizes recent advancements in language modeling and unsupervised feature learning (or deep learning) from sequences of words to graphs. DeepWalk uses local information obtained from truncated random walks to learn latent representations by treating walks as the equivalent of sentences. We demonstrate DeepWalk's latent representations on several multi-label network classification tasks for social networks such as BlogCatalog, Flickr, and YouTube. Our results show that DeepWalk outperforms challenging baselines which are allowed a global view of the network, especially in the presence of missing information. DeepWalk's representations can provide \$F\_1\$ scores up to 10\% higher than competing methods when labeled data is sparse. In some experiments, DeepWalk's representations are able to outperform all baseline methods while using 60\% less training data. DeepWalk is also scalable. It is an online learning algorithm which builds useful incremental results, and is trivially parallelizable. These qualities make it suitable for a broad class of real world applications such as network classification, and anomaly detection.},

The primary challenge in this domain is finding a way to represent, or encode, graph structure so that it can be easily exploited by machine learning models. Traditionally, machine learning approaches relied on user-defined heuristics to extract features encoding structural information about a graph (e.g., degree statistics or kernel functions). However, recent years have seen a surge in approaches that automatically learn to encode graph structure into low-dimensional embeddings, using techniques based on deep learning and nonlinear dimensionality reduction. Here we provide a conceptual review of key advancements in this area of representation learning on graphs, including matrix factorization-based methods, random-walk based algorithms, and graph neural networks. We review methods to embed individual nodes as well as approaches to embed entire (sub)graphs. In doing so, we develop a unified framework to describe these recent approaches, and we highlight a number of important applications and directions for future work.},

	abstract = {We present a new technique called "t-SNE" that visualizes high-dimensional data by giving each datapoint a location in a two or three-dimensional map. The technique is a variation of Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (Hinton and Roweis, 2002) that is much easier to optimize, and produces significantly better visualizations by reducing the tendency to crowd points together in the center of the map. t-SNE is better than existing techniques at creating a single map that reveals structure at many different scales. This is particularly important for high-dimensional data that lie on several different, but related, low-dimensional manifolds, such as images of objects from multiple classes seen from multiple viewpoints. For visualizing the structure of very large data sets, we show how t-SNE can use random walks on neighborhood graphs to allow the implicit structure of all of the data to influence the way in which a subset of the data is displayed. We illustrate the performance of t-SNE on a wide variety of data sets and compare it with many other non-parametric visualization techniques, including Sammon mapping, Isomap, and Locally Linear Embedding. The visualiza-tions produced by t-SNE are significantly better than those produced by the other techniques on almost all of the data sets.},

We also describe a simple alternative to the hierarchical softmax called negative sampling. An inherent limitation of word representations is their indifference to word order and their inability to represent idiomatic phrases. For example, the meanings of "Canada" and "Air" cannot be easily combined to obtain "Air Canada". Motivated by this example, we present a simple method for finding phrases in text, and show that learning good vector representations for millions of phrases is possible.},

Although his exposition in this paper is quite terse and couched in mathematical language which may be difficult for some readers of Management Science to follow, it is thought that this presentation will: (1) make available to American readers generally an important work in the field of linear programming, (2) provide an indication of the type of analytic work which has been done and is being done in connection with rational planning in Russia, (3) through the specific examples mentioned indicate the types of interpretation which the Russians have made of the abstract mathematics (for example, the potential and field interpretations adduced in this country recently by W. Prager were anticipated in this paper).

	title = {The impact of clinical pathways on the organisation of care processes},
	url = {https://lirias.kuleuven.be/retrieve/92842},
	abstract = {Summary Clinicians and healthcare managers give more attention to the organisation of care processes. One of the methods to organise care processes is clinical pathways. Clinical pathways are used worldwide in different kind of settings. Many publications describe positive effects of their implementation. Pathways are mainly used as a tool to improve the quality and efficiency of care processes. Therefore the question was raised: Whatis the effect of clinical pathways on the organisation of care processes? The study consists of four phases. In afirst phase, a literature study was performed on instruments to describe differences in clinical pathways. Seven clinical pathway audit tools were analysed. The Integrated Care Pathway Appraisal Tool was evaluated as the best tool available. Because of limitations in these audit tools, it was decided to use during the next phases of the study the implicit knowledge of the pathway facilitators to score if a clinical pathway was present. Secondly, a mix of qualitative and quantitative methods was used to define the characteristics of well organised care processes. In total more than 890 clinicians and healthcare managers from hospitals and primary care, and patients participated in the different phases to describe thesecharacteristics. Based on the characteristics a new tool was developed and validated to measure the organisation of care processes: The Care Process Self Evaluation Tool (CPSET). This 29 item instrument has 5 subscales: (i) the patient focused organisation, (ii) the coordination of the care process, (iii) the communication with patients and family, (iv) thecollaboration with primary care and (v) the follow-up of the care process. The tool was validated in a multicenter study including 142 care processes within the Belgian Dutch Clinical Pathway Network. Thirdly, in a study with 103 care processes we found out that clinical pathways have a significant positive impact on the coordination of care and the follow-up of the care process. Not all clinical pathways are well organised and not all well organised care processes are supported by clinical pathways. Fourthly, in a multicenter clinical trial including 39 organisations and 737consecutive patients with total joint replacement, the relations between the use of clinical pathways, the organisation of care processes (CPSET scores) and risk adjusted patient outcomes were analysed. Organisations using clinical pathways had significant higher scores on four out of five subscales of the CPSET. Only the patient focused organisation subscale was not significant. Clinical pathways lead to significantly lower length of stay and elapsed time-to-discharge. The communication with patients and family came out as one of the most important CPSET subscales forthis patient group. The length of stay was significantly determined by the use of clinical pathways, the coordination of the care process and the communication with patients and family. The elapsed time-to-dischargewas significantly determined by the use of clinical pathways and the coordination of the care process. A significant interaction effect betweenthe use of clinical pathways and the coordination of the care process was found for both risk adjusted in-hospital outcomes. We can conclude that clinical pathways are one of the main methodologies to organise and coordinate care processes but the methodology needs to be further improved. It is a complex intervention which has to be developed and continuously followed up by a team including clinicians, healthcare managers and patients.Based on this study we propose five main recommendations for healthcaremanagers, clinicians and policy makers: (i) Investing in care processesmeans investing in the coordination of care, communication with patients and family, cooperation with primary care, and continuous follow-up ofthe care process, all within a patient-focussed organisation. (ii) Clinical pathways have impact on the organisation of care processes and on patient outcomes but not all clinical pathways are well organised. The actual definition and methodology have therefore been revised. (iii) Patient expectations and characteristics should be further analysed and integrated into actual pathways. (iv) The Care Process Self Evaluation Tool (CPSET) is a validated instrument that can help teams and management to clarify their perspective on the actual organisation of care. This tool should always be used in cooperation with evidence-based performance indicators. Teams that work with clinical pathways have a more logical view of how their care processes are organised. (v) Clinical pathways represent more than the development and implementation of a new document or structure for a care process. Pathways are complex interventions that keep the structure, process, and outcome alive. They must be used as a methodto achieve a result.},
